1019,"AbbVie (ABBV) is trading substantially higher than last year, and I believe that the company will continue to grow throughout the year. ABBV is a leading biotech company that has the potential to generate impressive returns and has near-term upside potential. This company has a high degree of recession resilience, an optimistic near-term forecast, and a solid dividend yield, making it a great biotech stock. For a company that is always generously rewarding its shareholders, AbbVie has earned a high ranking among income investors. AbbVie's stock price has hit record highs, which is great for people who own the company's shares. The issue many new investors might have is whether it would be wise to buy now or wait for a lower entry point in the future. AbbVie shares have gone up recently, outperforming the market this year. The company has a rather impressive history and a proven track record. This makes it an attractive option for many investors. The company's core business continues to thrive and is executing well on its strategies. For now, ABBV offers an impressive dividend yield with a reasonable valuation versus the industry. Recession-Resistant Business The pandemic greatly impacted many industries, such as tourism, entertainment, and hospitality. These are just a few of the many examples. However, essential retail, such as grocery stores and food vendors, did not suffer as badly. In addition, the healthcare industry grew even more during the COVID-19 crisis. Most companies experienced a slump during the first quarter. AbbVie's success provides a lesson for many about how valuable, effective business management solutions are during times of crisis. The company has seen success thanks to its key drugs like Humira, a top-selling drug for the last three years, and Imbruvica, a game-changing drug that is seeing positive momentum in its sales this year. People need to go to the hospital no matter the state of the economy. The world is facing an aging population and a health care crisis. Therefore, companies like AbbVie are expected to thrive in this environment. AbbVie is a Premium Dividend Stock AbbVie is one of the best dividend stocks on the NYSE. Investors can be excited about a company with a solid lineup and pipeline. Even before we look at the excellent dividend track record from AbbVie, we can't help but feel excited. When you buy one investment, it can potentially compound into a significant income stream over time. However, this is best done with wise investments that require less risk and as little money as possible outside of your initial purchase. AbbVie shares offer a juicy yield of 3.54%. This number is higher than the S&P 500's (SPY) yield of 1.3%, meaning that your investment in this stock can give you more income opportunities in the future. The company promises shareholders a conservative cash payout ratio of 42.65%, which means that it can continue its dividend increases for years to come. What are the Risks for AbbVie? If you plan to invest in AbbVie, you must consider the company's debt load. Even though the company could pay down its debts in the coming years, if it does not happen, there can be potential financial difficulties for AbbVie. In addition, the costs of some drugs continue to rise. Some politicians are speaking out on social media against them, which could lead to pressure to reduce the costs of these drugs. In the past few years, bears have noticed that AbbVie's global patent protection for Humira will gradually end. They are waiting for this company to announce a new patent that can capture an exclusive market. AbbVie is preparing for this eventuality by increasing its revenue from acquisitions and developing new products. It can now face the post-Humira world confidently. Skyrizi and Rinvoq's technology generated $4.6 billion in revenue last year, with more growth expected in the next five years, and the company's future is looking bright. AbbVie has stated that Rinvoq and Skyrizi will be able to treat all of Humira's indications and also atopic dermatitis. AbbVie expects more than $15 billion in revenue from both products in 2025. In addition, the company has purchased Belgium-based company Syndesi Therapeutics, which will boost its neuroscience portfolio. Overall, AbbVie has a rich pipeline of active clinical programs. We can see that the company is not just one-hit successful and has many new projects coming online. Wall Street's Take Among the most influential companies in the healthcare industry, ABBV stock has done very well in recent times. However, this is weighing down investor sentiment. AbbVie holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and five Holds assigned in the last three months. At $159.27, the average AbbVie price target implies 2.1% upside potential. Bottom Line AbbVie is projected to grow over the coming years and has several interesting growth strategies that can be capitalized on through synergies. These would provide long-term profits for investors. For those looking to build a long-term portfolio that captures income, AbbVie is an attractive stock. It has an above-average dividend yield and looks like a resilient choice versus downturns. AbbVie is a great opportunity for value and income investors despite being at all-time highs. There are still good things to come that the stock will benefit from. This is the time to buy shares, as they'll undoubtedly gain further in the future.

The BTD program expedites the development and review of investigational medicines that have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence of substantial improvement over existing therapies on at least one clinically significant endpoint.



The Vice-President and Global Head of Oncology Clinical Development at AbbVie, Mohamed Zaki, said, “Patients with non-small cell lung cancer have a high unmet need and Teliso-V has the potential to provide them with an additional treatment option to manage their disease.”



Teliso-V’s BTD designation is based on data from an ongoing Phase 2 study, LUMINOSITY. The study is designed to identify the target NSCLC populations with high levels of c-Met overexpression and for whom Teliso-V monotherapy is best suited in the second- or third-line setting.



About AbbVie



Based out of Illinois, AbbVie is focused on therapeutic areas like immunology, oncology, neuroscience, eye care, virology, women's health and gastroenterology. Its subsidiary Allergan Aesthetics develops, manufactures and sells products, including facial injectables, body contouring, plastics, and skincare, among others.



Wall Street’s Take



Recently, Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target to $155 from $130 (14.7% upside potential).



Additionally, Christopher Raymond, an analyst with Piper Sandler (PIPR), maintained a Buy rating on AbbVie and increased the price target from $129 to $160 (18.4% upside potential).



In a research note to investors, Raymond said, “ABBV remains a top pick for me in 2022 amid continued commercial momentum from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. AbbVie also has an emerging neurology franchise as well as continued outperformance from the legacy Allergan aesthetics business.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and 3 Holds. The average ABBV stock forecast of $136.79 implies 1.2% upside potential. Shares have gained 34.2% over the past year.

1981,"AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceuticals worldwide.  The company was spun off of Abbott Labs in 2013 with essentially one product to sell, Humira.  



The company took the huge amounts of cash that was thrown off by Humira and invested more than $50 dollars into research and development to prepare for when Humira comes off patent in 2023.    



Today AbbVie has 48,000 employees and operates in the immunology, oncology, neuroscience, eye care, virology, woman’s health, and aesthetics spaces. Three-quarters of the medicines in its pipeline are first-of-kind, meaning they are the first to treat a particular disease through that mechanism of action. 



This is quite remarkable when considering this is a dividend stock that returns almost 4% of its value back to investors.



After reviewing AbbVie’s stock’s intrinsic value, the company’s plans to move past Humira, and what the Wall Street analysts and bloggers are saying, I am bullish on this stock. 



This is a good investment for value investors looking for a payout of approximately 4% with significant upside potential as the market realizes that AbbVie is much more than the company that markets and produces Humira.



Recent Results and Dividend



AbbVie brought in revenues of $55.169 billion over the last 12 months, with a net income of $7.542 billion. 



The company reported third-quarter earnings of $3.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $3.21 per share.  It has also reported $9.39 in earnings per share for the first nine months of 2021, beating analyst estimates of $9.10 for the first nine months of 2021. 



It has declared a dividend payable on January 12, 2022, of $1.41 per share, with a dividend yield of 4%.  This is an increase over the last quarterly dividend issued of $1.30 per share. This also marks the seventh straight year AbbVie has increased dividends. 



This is the rare dividend-paying stock where the growth rate of the dividend is outpacing inflation, meaning investors are gaining real purchasing power. Most investments lose value during high inflation, and AbbVie is an exception.   



The company shows strength on both the balance sheet and the income statement. The company has a current ratio of 1.015 which means that it has enough money and other current assets on hand to pay its bills over the next year. 



When I calculated the stock’s intrinsic value by modeling discounted cash flows, I pegged it at $201.33.  



Can The Stock Go Higher?



AbbVie has created a pipeline of pharmaceutical products that will act as a catalyst to drive the share price higher as investors realize that AbbVie is much more than the company that makes Humira. 



In addition to carrying out research and development activities on its own, AbbVie has also done a great job using the cash flow from Humira to buy blockbuster drugs like Rivoq and the Botox brand of cosmetic botulinum toxin, used to reduce skin wrinkles and treat migraine headaches.   



AbbVie has also partnered with over 220 companies, academic, and government institutions to strengthen its research and development pipeline. 



Wall Street’s Take



Fourteen Wall Street analysts currently cover AbbVie and have issued 12-month estimates for the price. Of the 14, 11 rate the stock as a Buy with a high forecast stock price of $172, an average stock price of $133, and a low stock price of $105. The average AbbVie price target represents 2.4% downside potential.







Conclusion



AbbVie has done a great job taking the vast amounts of free cash flows that Humira has generated and purchasing other blockbuster drugs. These will continue to throw off plenty of free cash flow to continue to pay the significant dividend increases that investors have become accustomed to.

Shares of AbbVie have gains of 25.9% in 2021 and have underperformed the S&P 500, although the underperformance is marginal. I am bearish on ABBV stock. High levels of debt and declining profitability margins are among the risk factors.



AbbVie Business News



Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, announced on December 16 that it had completed the acquisition of Soliton. The company believes that Solition's technology complements Allergan Aesthetics' portfolio of non-invasive body contouring treatments.



The company also announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved RINVOQ® for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. In addition, VUITY™ (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) 1.25%, the first and only eye drop approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat presbyopia, is now available by prescription in pharmacies nationwide.



Q3 Earnings



ABBV stock has rallied over 24% in the past three-month period, partly attributed to strong Q3 2021 financial results. Third-quarter diluted EPS of $1.78 on a GAAP basis showed an increase of 38.0% compared to EPS of $1.29 in Q3 2020. Net revenue of $14.3 billion was up 11.2% on a GAAP basis, and the firm raised its 2021 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range from $6.04 to $6.14 to $6.29 to $6.33.



Additional positive news includes announcing an 8.5% dividend increase in 2022, beginning with a dividend payable in February. The quarterly cash dividend increased from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share. AbbVie's dividend has been raised significantly over the past years.



Fundamental Risks



AbbVie's guidance increase and better than expected third-quarter earnings currently support the stock.



There are, however, several key risk factors to consider now. Gross margin, operating margins, and net margins have declined over the past five years. The TTM gross margin of 70.2% is very high, but it was even higher in 2019, at 77.6%.



The net margin of 9.9% in 2020 has declined significantly compared to 23.6% in 2019. The overall financial strength of AbbVie is not great due to a large debt level. In the last quarter, its D/E ratio was 5.96. 



AbbVie has increased its dividend, but the dividend payout ratio is now considered too high. The current dividend payout ratio of AbbVie Inc is 120%, which does not seem sustainable. There is also a tradeoff between growth and expanding operations. 



Very high dividend payout ratios come to at the expense of future growth opportunities and may lead to a dangerous decline in the firm's cash reserves. A stable payout ratio over many years is safer than a volatile trend.



On the positive side, AbbVie has a solid and positive free cash flow trend and, except for 2019, strong revenue growth. The revenue growth in the first nine months of 2021 has lost its momentum, especially for Q1, during which AbbVie reported a quarter-over-quarter decline of 6.12% compared to Q4 2020.



Valuation: Trading at a Premium



ABBV stock is relatively overvalued compared to its industry. Its P/E and P/B ratios are 31.5x and 17.4x, respectively. This compares to the industry averages of 26.1x and 2.7x, respectively.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, AbbVie has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 11 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average AbbVie price target of $133.00 implies -0.7% downside potential.

In addition, the sector's expansion in 2021 was aided by solid quarterly results, new product introductions, and regular M&A activity.



The pandemic, however, is far from over, especially because the virus's extremely infectious Omicron form has already spread to a number of nations. As a result, biotech companies will remain the focus of interest in 2022.



Therefore, for investors looking for a high-growth choice while also being ready to take on some additional risk, the biotech industry presents an unrivaled opportunity.



With this in mind, we examined TipRanks' database to find two biotech stocks that fit the bullish profile: a solid portfolio and a Strong Buy consensus rating.



Here’s the scoop.



Eli Lilly & Co.



Let's begin with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world. Lilly's pipeline assets for cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are all attractive.



Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes, and donanemab, a treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, are two promising pipeline prospects. Both candidates have the potential to deliver strong sales numbers. Both are anticipated to be approved next year.



Furthermore, due to increased projected revenues from its COVID-19 antibody drugs, Lilly upped its previously disclosed 2021 sales and earnings expectations earlier this month. In addition, Lilly's financial outlook for 2022 surpassed expectations: Lilly expects 2022 revenue to be between $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion. On February 3, the company is expected to release its upcoming earnings.



Trulicity and Jardiance (for treating Type 2 diabetes), along with Verzenio (an oncology drug), Taltz (an immunology drug), and other drugs, are expected to account for more than two-thirds of core sales in 2022, according to the company. Further, the expected launch of tirzepatide (a diabetes drug) and donanemab (an Alzheimer's drug) products should further drive sales in the near future.



Furthermore, Lilly is on track to introduce 20 new drugs between 2014 and 2023, having already introduced 16 new medicines in the previous eight years.



In response to the strong guidance provided by the management, Kerry Holford of Berenberg Bank rates Eli Lilly shares a Buy and increased the price target to $305 from $270. This figure suggests room for ~12% upside for the coming year.



Eli Lilly has a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, with 12 recent assessments, including 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is now trading at $273.1 and the average LLY price target of $291.75 implies around 7% upside from that level.







AbbVie



Second is AbbVie (ABBV), a biopharmaceutical firm that focuses on discovering and selling complete treatments for some of the world's most complex and severe diseases.



Imbruvica and Venclexta, the company's cancer medications, have been successful in increasing their labels. The company also has a number of novel medications in its pipeline that have the potential to boost income. It has a strong late-stage pipeline, with numerous early-stage and mid-stage candidates with blockbuster potential.



The business has been aggressively exploring partnerships and collaborations for candidates in immunology, cancer, aesthetics, neurology, eye care, and women's health, among other therapeutic areas. AbbVie's revenue base has been broadened into new therapeutic areas as a result of the acquisition of Allergan, improving its long-term growth prospects.



Furthermore, due to its diverse product offering and long-term dividend growth track record, the company is a popular choice among investors. Abbvie has been growing its dividend for the past 9 years, and boasts a payout ratio of 42.2%. 



On the analyst side, BMO Capital analyst Gary Nachman maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $134.00.



AbbVie has a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, with 14 recent assessments, including 11 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is now trading at $133.09 and the average ABBV price target of $133.00 implies that shares are fully valued at current levels.

2115,"AbbVie (ABBV) is an international, research-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing and marketing comprehensive therapies that aim to remedy some of the world's most complicated and severe diseases.



Following AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan plc last year, the company has formed a diversified biopharmaceutical product portfolio. It is positioned in key therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care, and women's health.



In fact, the combination of AbbVie's original product portfolio and its enhanced pipeline following acquiring Allergan's assets should benefit the merged company's commercial strength and international infrastructure substantially, in my view.



AbbVie's shares have significantly rallied over the past year, hovering near all-time high levels. However, the stock's valuation remains rather attractive, while its 4.65% yield makes for a strong capital return component. For this reason, I am bullish on the stock. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Q3 Results: Another Steady Quarter 



AbbVie's Q3 results came in quite strong, with the company generating revenues of $14.3 billion during the period, an 11.3% increase year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher sales in several of its drugs, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Amid scaling economics, Abvvie's EPS came in at $3.33, 17.7% higher compared to Q3 2020.



Following a stronger-than-expected quarter, management hiked its Fiscal Year 2021 guidance. The company now anticipates delivering EPS between $12.63 - $12.67, suggesting a considerable improvement compared to last year.



Back in October, the company also declared a dividend hike by 8.5%, raising the quarterly dividend per share (DPS) to $1.41 per share. In my view, this suggests robust confidence from management when it comes to AbbVie's short and medium-term profitability growth prospects.



The Dividend and Valuation



Combined with its dividend increases from before its spin-off from Abbot Laboratories, AbbVie has ""unofficially"" grown its dividend annually for 49 consecutive years. 



Despite such a prolonged track record implying a very mature business, AbbVie's five-year DPS CAGR stands at an impressive 17.9%. Following equally strong EPS growth during this period, the payout ratio is quite comfortable as well. Based on this year's expected EPS, the payout ratio should remain just under 45%.



Regarding future profitability growth, note that AbbVie's management believes that despite Humira's revenues weakening in the mid-2020s amid the patent's expiry, company-wide revenues in 2025 will be higher than last year. This displays AbbVie's robust performance and strong diversification prospects going forward, in my view.



Despite its above-average yield of 4.65%, which is quite substantial in the current environment of ultra-low yields, AbbVie's shares are very reasonably valued. 



At the midpoint of management's guidance, the stock is trading at a P/E of 9.6x. Hence, investors should be enjoying a relatively broad margin of safety at the stock's current levels, hardly facing any risk of a potential valuation multiple compression, in my view. If anything, a valuation expansion towards a more reasonable multiple in the low teens is likely to add on total returns.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, AbbVie has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on ten Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $131.91, the average AbbVie price target implies 8.7% upside potential.

2145,"Biopharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV) updated the U.S. Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for RINVOQ (upadacitinib), a selective JAK inhibitor designed to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 



Reason for Update  



On September 1, 2021, a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) was issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a final review of the post-marketing study, ORAL Surveillance. The study evaluated XELJANZ (tofacitinib) in patients with RA. Results of the study showed that XELJANZ (a JAK inhibitor) was more prone to major adverse cardiac events (MACE), malignancy, mortality, and thrombosis than TNF blockers.



Therefore, the DSC and the label update apply to the class of systemically administered FDA-approved JAKs designed for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases.



Following the FDA’s update, RINVOQ will now reflect some additional information in the U.S. label related to its risks. This will include malignancy and thrombosis, as well as mortality and MACE (including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) risks. Furthermore, the updated indication will stand as; “RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.” (See AbbVie stock charts on TipRanks) 



Official Comments 



President of AbbVie, Michael Severino, said, ""RINVOQ is an important treatment option for people living with rheumatoid arthritis, especially those who have not been able to achieve remission or low disease activity. We remain committed to continue generating evidence that support its benefit-risk profile across many inflammatory conditions.” 



Notably, review of supplemental New Drug Applications (NDAs) for upadacitinib (RINVOQ) in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and ulcerative colitis are ongoing with the FDA.

Wall Street’s Take 



On November 29, UBS analyst Navin Jacob reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $129 (8.54% upside potential) from $126. 



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys versus 2 Holds. The average AbbVie price target of $132.17 implies 11.21% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 12.3% over the past year. 



Bloggers Weigh In 



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on AbbVie, compared to a sector average of 69%.

These patients include individuals who have had an inadequate response or have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  



The marketing authorization for SKYRIZI will be valid in all member states of the European Union, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland.  



The regulator’s approval followed the data from two Phase 3 clinical studies, KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2. The data demonstrated that SKYRIZI met the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 24 versus placebo. 



Markedly, the safety profile of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile of SKYRIZI in plaque psoriasis, with no new safety risks.

2282,"AbbVie (ABBV) has presented integrated data from two Phase 3 clinical trials, KEEPsAKE 1 and KEEPsAKE 2. These studies are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab (SKYRIZI) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). 



The data demonstrated by the biopharmaceutical company showed that 24-weeks of treatment with risankizumab resulted in substantial improvements in PsA signs and symptoms compared with placebo with no new safety signals, the company said.  



(See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks >>) 



Notably, in the U.S. or the EU, the use of risankizumab in psoriatic arthritis is not approved, and its safety and efficacy are under review by the respective regulatory authorities. 



Recently, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) put forward a positive opinion recommending the approval of risankizumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. 



The CSO of AbbVie, Thomas Hudson, said, ""Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, progressive and debilitating disease. These results support the potential of risankizumab to help improve joint and skin symptoms for people living with this disease and assist more people in their pursuit of reaching their treatment goals."" (See AbbVie stock charts on TipRanks) 



Wall Street’s Take 



Recently, BMO Capital analyst Gary Nachman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $134 (14.35% upside potential) from $133. 



Nachman said, ""3Q delivered solid results and showed benefits of improved diversification with good upside in Immunology, Aesthetics, and Neuro more-than-offsetting misses in Hem/Onc and Other, while lower spend helped drive better profitability and higher EPS guidance. ABBV expressed confidence in Rinvoq situation, and raising 2022 dividend 8.5% supports optimistic LT outlook. Pipeline execution has been strong with recent Qulipta/Vuity approvals, and positive Ph3 data for ABBV-951 and Vraylar MDD, which should help drive multiple expansion."" 



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average AbbVie price target of $130.56 implies 11.42% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 23.2% over the past year.

2335,"Biopharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV) provided upbeat guidance for 2021 after it posted better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of 2021 on Friday. The company has also increased its quarterly dividend. Following the news, shares of the company jumped 4.56% to close at $114.67.



ABBV recorded adjusted earnings of $3.33 per share, above the consensus estimate of $3.23 per share. It had reported adjusted earnings of $2.83 per share in the prior-year quarter.



Total revenues generated during the quarter stood at $14.34 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year on a reported basis. The figure, however, fell short of the Street’s estimate of $14.65 billion.



Notably, Immunology revenues increased 15.3% year-over-year to $6.7 billion, while Hematologic Oncology revenues jumped 8.4% to $1.9 billion. Additionally, Aesthetics recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, up 29.3%.



While the adjusted gross margin was 83.2%, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses came in at 20.6% of net revenues during the quarter. Adjusted research and development expenses were 11.4% of net revenues.



Pipeline Update & Guidance



The CEO of AbbVie, Richard A. Gonzalez, said, “Based upon our strong momentum, we are increasing our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. We remain highly confident in AbbVie’s long-term outlook and are once again raising our dividend, which has grown over 250 percent since inception.” (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



For 2021, the company expects adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.63 to $12.67 against the consensus estimate of $12.59. The prior range stood at $12.52 per share to $12.62 per share.



Recently, the company revealed the results from two Phase 3 clinical trials, Study 3111-301-001 and Study 3111-302-001. The trails evaluated the efficacy and safety of cariprazine (VRAYLAR) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and met its primary endpoint.



Additionally, Allergan, an AbbVie company, received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval for VUITY (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) 1.25%. It is a first-of-its-kind FDA-approved eye drop that is designed for the treatment of presbyopia, an age-related blurry near vision, in adults.



Increase in Dividend



AbbVie’s board of directors announced an increased quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share of the company’s common stock, up 8.5% from the prior payout of $1.30 per share. The new dividend will be paid on February 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of January 14. The company’s annual dividend of $5.64 per share reflects a dividend yield of 4.92%.



Analysts Recommendation



Impressed with the company’s third-quarter results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan maintained a Buy rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $132 (15.11% upside potential) from $131.



Divan said, “Rinvoq concerns have pressured the stock in recent months, but we continue to see large opportunities for the product, especially in rheumatology and gastroenterology, and value the more diversified growth story AbbVie has become following the Allergan acquisition.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The average AbbVie price target stands at $130.08, implying upside potential at 13.44% over the next 12 months. Shares have gained almost 30% over the past year.



Risk Analysis 



According to the new TipRanks’ Risk Factors tool, the AbbVie stock is at risk mainly from three factors: Finance and Corporate, Production and Tech and Innovation, which contribute 26%, 23% and 19%, respectively, to the total 31 risks identified for the stock.

Notably, the study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of ABBV-951 (foslevodopa/foscarbidopa) to oral levodopa/carbidopa in advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. It is being investigated for patients whose motor symptoms are not controlled by oral medications.



According to the company, patients who received daily ABBV-951 showed statistically significant increases in hours of “On” time without troublesome dyskinesia (involuntary movements), which can impact daily activities, compared to oral LD/CD. Globally, more than 10 million people are suffering from this disease.



VC of AbbVie, Michael Severino, said, “Parkinson’s disease is a progressive, irreversible neurological disease with debilitating symptoms that can make daily life challenging. We’re committed to addressing the continued needs of patients and are encouraged by these results that highlight a potential alternative treatment option for those affected by advanced Parkinson’s disease.”



Wall Street's Take



On October 14, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $131 (19.45% upside potential).



Divan expects “a solid quarter, with focus to remain on key growth drivers such as Humira, Imbruvica, and Rinvoq, and the health of the aesthetics business through the pandemic.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys versus two Holds. The average AbbVie price target of $129.58 implies 18.2% upside potential from current levels.
