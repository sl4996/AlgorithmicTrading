457,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced casinos to temporarily shut down their operations and lay off workers. However, the rapid roll-out of vaccines and pent-up demand following the easing of restrictions has helped them bounce back strongly, though business continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. While uncertainty related to COVID-19 and labor challenges prevail, several casino owners are better positioned than last year to streamline their operations and focus on lucrative avenues like sports betting and online gaming. We used the TipRanks stock comparison tool for casino stocks to compare MGM Resorts, Wynn Resorts, and Caesars Entertainment. This tool allows us to compare and analyze up to ten stocks across various performance metrics, including technical indicators, analyst estimates, price targets, earning data, and more.  MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) MGM Resorts’ portfolio includes 32 hotels and gaming destinations in the U.S. and Macau, including popular resort brands like Bellagio, MGM Grand, ARIA, and Park MGM. MGM has also emerged as one of the key players in the sports betting and online gaming market through BetMGM, a joint venture with Entain Plc, launched in 2018. On April 4, BetMGM launched its online sports betting and iGaming platforms in Ontario, Canada, thus making its international debut. Including Ontario, BetMGM now has a presence in 23 markets. With more U.S. states legalizing sports betting, MGM sees BetMGM as a vital growth driver. MGM and Entain plan to invest $450 million in BetMGM this year. The company expects BetMGM operations to deliver net revenue of over $1.3 billion in 2022, up from $850 million in 2021.   Aside from BetMGM, the company is also investing in its digital capabilities and in developing an integrated casino resort in Japan. Meanwhile, MGM reported stellar results for Q421 and posted adjusted EPS of $0.12 compared to a loss per share of $0.90 in Q420, driven by a 105% year-over-year growth in revenue to $3.1 billion. The company’s Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 277% and 51%, respectively, and were also above pre-pandemic levels. However, revenue from MGM China grew by a modest 3% year-over-year and was down 57% compared to Q419. The company cited travel and entry restrictions associated with COVID-19 as the reason for its subdued performance in China. Following the Q4 results, Citigroup analyst George Choi upgraded MGM stock to a Buy from a Hold and increased the price target to $57 from $43. Choi feels that MGM is a major beneficiary of the solid recovery in Las Vegas and the rest of the country. The analyst added, “We also like the casino operator for its leaner cost structure and its improved gearing (after a series of asset monetization transactions). The latest update from management on BetMGM also points to encouraging market share trends (and the JV is expected to be EBITDA-positive by 2023E).” Meanwhile, the Street seems divided about MGM stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys and six Holds. The average MGM Resorts price target of $56.75 implies 33.53% upside potential from current levels. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) Wynn Resorts operates Wynn Las Vegas, Encore Boston Harbor, Wynn Macau, and Wynn Palace. Also, the company has a nearly 74% interest in Wynn Interactive, which operates the company’s digital sports betting and casino gaming business. In February, Wynn announced an agreement to sell all of the land and real estate assets of Encore Boston Harbor to Realty Income for $1.7 billion in cash under a sale-leaseback transaction. The company believes that the proceeds from the deal will provide it with liquidity for several upcoming projects and the potential to retire some of its debt. Meanwhile, China’s stringent restrictions amid rising COVID-19 cases continue to hurt Macau’s gaming business. Wynn has higher exposure to Macau than rival MGM. In Q421, Wynn’s operating revenues increased 53.5% year-over-year to $1.05 billion, ahead of analyst forecasts of $994.1 million. Adjusted net loss per share narrowed to $1.37 from a loss of $2.45 in Q420, but was worse than analysts’ loss per share estimate of $1.25. A strong recovery in the company’s Wynn Las Vegas and Encore Boston Harbor operations was offset by the weakness in its Macau operations (which includes Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace). That said, Wynn remains confident that the Macau market will benefit from increased travel over the coming quarters.      However, citing the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, a Bloomberg report disclosed that Macau’s gross gaming revenue in March 2022 sank 53% from the previous month (and 86% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019) to 3.67 billion patacas ($455 million), the lowest since September 2020. Regarding casinos with exposure to Macau, Choi recently commented, “For most of 2020-21, share prices of the Macau casino operators were driven by border re-opening expectations (and, unfortunately, the resetting of such expectations).” However, the analyst expects different catalysts to drive share prices this year, including the expected passing of Macau’s Gaming Law amendments and the license re-tendering process. Choi believes that Wynn’s valuation is “undemanding” following the selloff in its shares and that the company should benefit from its increasing focus on the premium end of the mass market in Macau.   Based on his optimism, Choi upgraded Wynn to a Buy from a Hold but reduced the price target to $96.50 from $98. All in all, Wynn stock has received five Buy and seven Hold recommendations for a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus rating. Further, the average Wynn Resorts price target of $107.54 puts its upside potential at 31.40%.      Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR) Caesars Entertainment was formed by combining Caesars Entertainment Corp and Eldorado Resorts in 2020, with the combined company operating over 50 casinos worldwide. Further, the company’s sports wagering mobile app, Caesars Sportsbook, is live across 22 states and domestic jurisdictions, 16 of which offer mobile wagering. Last month, Caesars Sportsbook partnered with NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, to launch a new horse racing account wagering app, Caesars Racebook. Meanwhile, Caesars’ Q421 revenue grew 63.5% year-over-year to $2.59 billion, and net loss per share improved to $2.03 from $2.67 in Q420. However, analysts were expecting revenue of $2.63 billion and a lower net loss per share of $0.83. The company’s bottom line was impacted by the Omicron outbreak and investments in the digital business.   Despite the Q421 performance, Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski believes that right now, the risk-reward scenario in Caesars' stock is “too compelling to ignore.” Wieczynski  explained, “From here, we see five potential catalysts for the remainder of 2022 that should allow shares to return to triple-digit land. We believe CZR remains well-positioned long term as the world eventually recovers from this pandemic given their compelling asset mix (Vegas/regionals/sports betting/iGaming).” Wieczynski continues to believe that the company has the best management team in gaming, capable of creating significant shareholder value in 2022 and beyond. The analyst expects multiples for Caesars’ brick and mortar business to drift back in line with historical ranges as free cash flow ramps up and the balance sheet improves. Wieczynski reaffirmed a Buy rating on CZR stock and raised the price target to $127 from $120. Other analysts on the Street echo Wieczynski’s bullish stance, with Caesars' stock scoring a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 unanimous Buys. The average Caesars Entertainment price target of $120.08 implies 48.82% upside potential from current levels. Conclusion While all the three stocks are in the red year-to-date, analysts are more confident about Caesars Entertainment, with expectations of a strong recovery and higher upside potential over the next 12 months.

476,"Caesars Entertainment (CZR) is a U.S.-based hotel and casino entertainment company. CZR has one of the biggest and most diversified portfolios of destinations in the United States, including some excellent resorts offering unique amenities and at the same time sharing a common goal of providing exceptional service and elating experiences to the customers. Two successful gaming leaders, Caesars Entertainment and Eldorado Resorts, came together in 2020 to form this present Caesars Entertainment. Caesars Entertainment has faced a lot of complexities in its 2015 post-bankruptcy life, but the company has more or less carved a path for itself in the past seven years. Caesars even sailed through the pandemic as people who were bereft of entertainment options turned to its casinos for solace. However, the stock stopped being the market's darling at the end of last year. It has lost ~12% of its value in the past year and about 14% year-to-date. Yet, considering the series of developments it has been making these days and the extensive prospects the online betting industry holds for the future, the market is hugely optimistic about the future performance of the Caesars Entertainment stock. Many analysts consider it a strong Buy. We are bullish on it as well. Caesars Entertainment is a good quality sports-betting stock. The company has been working really hard to turn things around by implementing a series of interesting strategies. Recently, it launched its Sportsbook, a mobile application for sports wagering purposes, in the state of Illinois for downloading and registration. The company feels this wagering application would help it to extend its consumer reach across more states, thereby increasing its revenues and boosting its overall growth. So, if things go as planned, the company might emerge as an undisputed leader in this space by capitalizing on the growing demand for sports betting. Daniel Politzer, a Wall Street Analyst from Wells Fargo, feels quite the same about Caesars Entertainment and has therefore rated the stock as a buy a few days back. However, he has also given an Overweight rating to its shares and has lowered the price target from $127 to $105 because of the lower-than-expected Q4 EBITDAR result that had occurred due to some regional shortfalls. Besides, he has also said that though the Las Vegas Strip demand has already started to recover and regional trends have improved from January into February, some EBITDA drags are still expected this year. Increasing Demand for Online Sports Betting The U.S. sports betting industry has witnessed immense growth since the pandemic, as remote lifestyles drove more people to engage in it. This growth has been a result of the legalization of sports betting across 30 states in the United States since the removal of the Federal ban on sports wagering in 2018. According to the American Gaming Association, last year in the United States, the commercial gaming industry has generated a milestone of $53 billion in revenue. This figure should increase in the coming years. Some concerns like the Fed's hawkish monetary stance and the Russia-Ukraine conflict might pose some short-term difficulties to the growth of this industry, but with all the ongoing technological evolution and favorable government policies, the condition of the sports betting industry is expected to improve further in the coming times. Being one of the popular participants in this industry, Caesars Entertainment can take significant advantage of this. Improved Financials The financials of Caesars Entertainment have been improving gradually, and the amount of losses is also coming down with time. In the fourth quarter of 2021, however, it could not meet market expectations. That said, the company generated a revenue of $2.6 billion compared to the $1.6 billion generated a year ago, and its losses also came down to $434 million this quarter from $555 million in the same period last year. Moreover, the same-store adjusted EBITDA also improved by $233 million year-over-year, and the same-store adjusted EBITDA excluding its Digital segment improved by a massive $573 million. The increased synergy target from its July 2020 merger with Eldorado Resorts has been one of the driving forces behind this improvement. Interesting Growth Strategies Caesars Entertainment has been developing a series of exciting strategies that have made the market pretty interested in it. As discussed earlier, it recently launched Sportsbook, its sports wagering mobile application in Illinois, to grab more investors, making the application live in 22 states and jurisdictions in the United States. Recently, Sportsbook has entered into a contract with NYRABets LLC to launch a new horse racing account wagering app called Caesars Racebook which will be available for download this spring. This will let both companies provide horse racing content from more than 250 tracks worldwide. Further, to also grab the attention of poker lovers, it will conduct the World Series of Poker and has released the schedule for it. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, 12 out of 12 analysts have given Caesars Entertainment a Buy Rating, making it a Strong Buy. The highest price target for the stock is $183, which is a potential upside of a little over 127.6%. The average Caesars Entertainment price target is $119.50, which implies a healthy 48.6% upside potential on the stock. Conclusion The global sports-betting industry is growing, and Caesars Entertainment is an integral part of this industry, too. The stock is still relatively cheap now, as it is much closer to its 52-week low than its high. So, investors who want to venture into this risky yet lucrative sports-betting market can consider the Caesars Entertainment stock at this point.

644,"Super Bowl LVI airs Sunday, Feb. 13 on NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp (NASDAQ: CMCSA). Millions will tune in to watch the Los Angeles Rams take on the Cincinnati Bengals in the National Football League’s championship game. Many will also tune in to watch the commercials from public and private companies.
Super Bowl LVI commercials had a cost that averaged $6.5 million for a 30-second spot, a high price to pay to get an ad seen by a massive audience. For many companies, the commercials prove to be hits and can help show off new products and initiatives.
Here are some publicly traded companies that have Super Bowl LVI commercials that could see stock price movement if their ads and messages are well received Sunday.
Yum Brands: For the first time since 2016, Taco Bell is featured in a Super Bowl commercial. The company, which is owned by Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM) will feature music superstar Doja Cat in a commercial called “The Grande Escape.” The commercial features a remake of the song “Celebrity Skin” by Hole and encourages fans to download the Taco Bell app and to be members of the Taco Bell Rewards program. The ad coincides with Taco Bell celebrating its 60th anniversary and the company’s “Live Mas” slogan turning 10 years old.
Polestar: Electric vehicle company Polestar, which is merging with Gores Guggenheim Inc (NASDAQ: GGPI), will air its first ever Super Bowl commercial. A 30-second ad will air during the first quarter of the game. The company has not shared much ahead of the game, which could create more of a mystery element. The commercial could continue to increase brand awareness for Polestar, which is working on completing its SPAC merger and hoping to become a major player in the electric vehicle sector.
Caesars Entertainment: Sports betting will be a big theme around Super Bowl LVI with more states able to legally wager on the outcome of the game and hundreds of various prop bets. Sports betting companies will also air commercials to highlight their brands and potential huge promotions in an attempt to gain customers. Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR) will air its first ever Super Bowl commercial, which will feature JB Smoove, Halle Berry and the Manning family. Interestingly enough, Caesars will also air a new commercial during the Puppy Bowl on Sep 13 too, a game airing on Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA) channel Animal Planet.
The commercial comes as Caesars Sportsbook took a surprising first place market share position in New York for the first month of legal sports betting. The company could look to continue to capture momentum there and in other states as it competes with the larger online sportsbooks.
General Motors: Super Bowl commercials are notorious for featuring celebrities, and also for sometimes reuniting stars of shows or movies. General Motors (NYSE: GM) could have one of the most talked about Super Bowl LVI commercials Sunday with an ad that will reunite members from the Austin Powers franchise. The ad centers on Dr. Evil taking over General Motors.
“We are using climate change as the enemy,” General Motors Global Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl said.
The 60-second commercial centers on General Motors’ efforts in the electric vehicle space, with a focus on its Ultium platform. The commercial will hit on the range of Ultium and could help GM highlight the progress it is making.
Meta Platforms: Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) will air a Super Bowl commercial that is being used to highlight the company’s heavy focus on expansion into the metaverse. There are not a lot of details out on the commercial yet, other than a teaser featuring a fictional Chuck E. Cheese virtual reality hangout. FB shares fell after its last earnings report, and some are questioning the company’s efforts and spending on the metaverse. Could a Super Bowl commercial help get the message of the metaverse potential across?
Anheuser-Busch: Massive beverage company Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD) is a frequent Super Bowl commercial purchaser. The company will use this year’s big game as an opportunity to promote some of its new products and smaller brands, while also featuring its iconic Clydesdale horse in at least one ad.
Anheuser-Busch will feature its new zero carb beer Bud Light NEXT in a commercial that features nods to NFTs and the metaverse. Bud Light Seltzer will be featured in an ad that could be a fan favorite with Guy Fieri and mentions of the fictional Flavortown. Michelob Ultra and the company’s Cutwater Spirtis canned cocktail brand will also be seen in ads.
Wallbox: Electric vehicle charging company Wallbox (NYSE: WBX) will air a 15-second commercial that features a lightning strike survivor. The commercial features Seth Thomas, who was struck by lightning and is afraid of electricity, except for the charging powered by Wallbox. The ad continues a trend of electric vehicle commercials being aired during the Super Bowl and could help boost the recognition of the company that went public via SPAC merger.
Vroom: Several online car marketplace companies will air Super Bowl commercials, with $1.1 billion market cap Vroom Inc (NASDAQ: VRM) among them and likely the one that could get the biggest boost in value. The company will highlight why users should sell online by staging a fake musical called “Flake” that highlights how used car buyers can easily back out of deals. This is the second consecutive Super Bowl commercial appearance by the company.
Planet Fitness: Fitness retailer Planet Fitness (NYSE: PLNT) will air its first Super Bowl commercial Sunday and is bringing along several celebrities. The ad features Lindsay Lohan and follows her around with narration by William Shatner. Cameos include Dennis Rodman and Danny Trejo, while the commercial also pokes fun at some of Lohan’s biggest news stories.
The commercial ends with the narrator saying, “Maybe it’s not what’s gotten into Lindsay, it’s what Lindsay’s gotten into.” Lohan is seen leaving a Planet Fitness location.
Squarespace: Online website builder Squarespace Inc (NYSE: SQSP) has become a frequent Super Bowl ad buyer in recent years, using celebrities to help highlight how easy it is to create a website on the site. This year’s ad will be narrated by Andre 3000 and feature Zendaya. The commercial shows Zendaya as the seller of seashells by the seashore who has seen sales slow and needs a new outlet.

837,"Based in Reno, Nevada, Caesars Entertainment (CZR) is the largest provider in the United States of America, and one of the most diversified in the world, of modern casino entertainment services. Those services include poker, lottery-style gambling, racing and online sportsbooks. 



As a gambling company, Caesars operates more than 54,500 slot machines and approximately 3,200 table games, in addition to several video lottery terminals and electronic tables.



Through its portfolio of branded restaurants and entertainment venues, Caesars is also known as a hospitality company in the U.S., where it owns and operates bars, nightclubs, lounges and hotels.



The U.S. resort and casino operator is the owner and manager of approximately 47,700 hotel rooms, including those rented out to other companies.



Since January 2019, Caesars HAS outperformed the best hotel stocks by a wide margin, which could have been even bigger if the stock had not fallen more than 15% in the past three months.



I expect this stock to experience more dips, due to the global worsening of COVID-19 infections. In addition, the company does not pay dividends. So as of today, despite a lower market valuation, I would not recommend a higher rating than Hold. Thus, I am neutral on this stock. 



Q3 Earnings Results



Caesars Entertainment earnings results were mixed. The company ended the third quarter of 2021 with a net loss of $1.10 per share (an improvement from -$6.09 the previous year), missing the average analyst estimate by $1.17. Total revenue came in at $2.69 billion (up nearly 95% year-over-year), surpassing the median projection by about $30 million.



Outlook 



The COVID-19 crisis has hit some sectors harder than others, so far. The most severely affected by lockdowns and other restrictions intended to limit the spread of the infection are the travel and hospitality industries, as well as the resort and casino operators.



The main reason for their vulnerability is that these companies earn money when people enter their environments and enjoy the various experiences they offer. The same principle also works for gambling and betting.



Omicron brings more uncertainties, as the scientific community still has doubts about whether the vaccine will protect against the new variant. The levels of aggressiveness and the mortality of the mutated virus also remain unknown.



Thus, there is a good chance that the U.S. and other governments will increase anti-COVID-19 measures, even before the Christmas holidays. Precautions are necessary because these save lives, but at the same time, they cause headwinds for Caesars Entertainment and other operators.



Wall Street’s Take 



In the past three months, 10 Wall Street analysts have issued a 12-month price target for CZR. The company has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 9 Buys, one Hold and zero Sell ratings.



The average Caesars Entertainment price target is $139.33, implying 58,5% upside potential.







Summary 



I am neutral on this stock, as I expect further declines because more anti-COVID-19 measures are needed to counter the new threat called Omicron. The restrictions are likely to leave a mark on restaurants, hotels, and the catering and travel industries, as well as casinos and resorts, including Caesars and other operators.

Caesars Entertainment (CZR)



First up is Caesars Entertainment, a venerable name in the casino industry. The modern incarnation of the company was formed in 2020, from a merger-by-purchase, when Eldorado Resorts bought Caesars and then took on the name. The current company boasts 53 casino, resort, and hotel properties, mostly in the US but with one location each in Canada and Dubai. Nearly one-third of Caesars’ properties, 16 total, are located in the State of Nevada.



It’s hard to find an industry that drips cash as copiously as casino gaming, and even during the pandemic ‘panic year’ of 2020 Caesars’ managed to bring in $3.5 billion in top-line revenue. This year, with the economy mostly reopened, and consumers both flush with cash and on the prowl for entertainment and leisure, Caesars has already seen $6.89 billion in revenue – just for the first three quarters.



That’s the good news. Earnings, however, are not keeping up, and the company saw a $1.08 loss in Q3, a far cry from the 8-cent positive EPS analysts had expected. It’s important to note that Caesars has seen only one quarter of positive earnings in the last two years, in 2Q21.



The company has been working hard to turn earnings around, following a strategic plan to increase income. In one facet of this, Caesars in April of this year bought the sports betting company William Hill, in a transaction valued at $3.7 billion. The acquisition was rebranded as Caesars Sportsbook, and Caesars recouped much of the purchase price when it sold the European side of the business for $3 billion to 888 Holdings.



In his review of this industry giant, B. Riley's 5-star analyst David Bain writes: “We believe Caesar’s iconic brand and loyalty synergies from its peer-high room count/scale and rewards membership are scarce attributes. Despite portfolio outperformance and advantages versus peers, our $143 per share land-based valuation utilizes target multiples in line with peers and historical averages—conservative, in our view.”



Bain goes on to add, in regard to the company’s outlook and expansion plans, “We believe CEO Tom Reeg’s deal track record indicates there is ‘more to come,’ potentially (ultimately) unleashing a better digital valuation than peers with better than investor expected market share gains.”



In line with his outlook, Bain rates CZR shares a Buy, and his $191 one-year price target implies an upside of 104%. (To watch Bain’s track record, click here)



Overall, this stock has 11 analyst reviews on record, and from the breakdown it’s clear that Wall Street agrees with Bain; there are 10 Buys against just a single Hold. CZR shares are priced at $93.48 and their $139.70 average price target suggests room for ~50% growth the current share price. (See CZR stock analysis on TipRanks)







Paragon 28 (FNA)



The second stock we’ll look at is about as different from Caesars as it is possible for a stock to get. Paragon 28 is a medical device company, specializing in orthopedic foot and ankle treatments. The company name even references the number of bones found in the foot. Paragon 28’s product line includes a range of surgical aids and orthopedic prosthetics and implants, all aimed at improving patient outcomes and maintaining function in the feet.



Founded in 2010, Paragon 28 is nevertheless new to the public markets. The company held its initial public offering in October of this year, with the FNA ticker making its Wall Street debut on October 15. The offering saw more than 7.8 million shares go up for sale, with an initial price of $16 each. Overall, the company raised $125 million in gross proceeds from the sale.



Of interest to investors, Paragon 28 released its 3Q21 earnings report in November. The company showed $35.9 million in top line revenue, a solid figure that represents a gain of 18% from last year’s Q3, and a gain of 45% from pre-pandemic levels in 3Q19. Looking ahead to Q4, the company expects 8%-11% year-over-year growth, ahead of Street expectations of ~2%.



Canaccord's 5-star analyst Kyle Rose is bullish on this company, writing: “Paragon 28 came in with a solid first print as a public company, beating guidance and the Street despite a difficult 3Q/21 backdrop given the continued strain of CV19 variants on procedure deferrals and staffing shortages. The company saw continued momentum within the business globally and, despite a somewhat conservative guide for the 4Q with COVID lingering, we expect the groundwork for growth acceleration in 2022+ has been put in place.""



""With a broad portfolio of solutions for foot and ankle disorders, a compelling pipeline of iterative new product launches, and a strong/expanding commercial team, we believe Paragon 28 is reaching its growth stride and positioned to take share in the fastest-growing segment of the orthopedic market,” the analyst summed up.



Rose's upbeat outlook leads him to put a Buy rating on the stock, and his price target, of $27, implies an upside of ~46% for the year ahead. (To watch Rose’s track record, click here)



The Street is in agreement with the bullish position here and all 4 of the recent reviews on Paragon 28 are positive, supporting the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading for $19.24 and have an average price target of $29.75, suggesting an upside of ~55% in the next 12 months. (See FNA stock analysis on TipRanks)
