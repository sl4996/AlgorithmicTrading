Further, any respite from all these troubles does not seem anywhere near the horizon. In such a scenario, TipRanks’ Smart Portfolio tool can act as a guiding force for investors looking to make profitable investment decisions. The TipRanks Smart Portfolio allows investors to benchmark their portfolios against the best performing portfolios on TipRanks and also the average TipRanks Portfolios. Notably, the burgeoning online payments sector occupies a sizeable portion of the best performing portfolios on TipRanks. According to a report by Statista, the total transaction value in the digital payments sector is forecast to reach $1.8 trillion in 2022. Further, the total transaction value for the period 2022-2026 is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.45%. It is also likely to reach a total amount of $3.2 trillion by 2026. Therefore, an investment in the online payments space can be an attractive choice for investors. The new and improved TipRanks Smart Portfolio picks out the proverbial diamonds from the rough and brings us two stocks that are part of the best performing portfolios. Let’s have a look at them. Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) With a market cap of $49 billion, the San Francisco, CA-based company is a financial services and digital payments company, which is spearheaded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Earlier known as Square, the payments platform is aimed at serving small and medium businesses. Block has an allocation of 3.33% in the Best Performing Portfolio on TipRanks. However, the stock has been a laggard so far this year, down 48.6%, compared to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index’s decline of 25.9%. Recently, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $126, which implies upside potential of 49.3% from current levels. Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys and five Holds. Block's average price target of $162.15 implies upside potential of 92.1% from current levels. Shares have declined 61.8% over the past year. TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Block’s performance this quarter. According to the tool, the Block website recorded a 29.39% monthly rise in global visits in April against the same period last year. Further, the footfall on the company's website has increased 30.35% year-to-date, compared to the previous year. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) Commanding a market cap of over $91 billion, San Jose, CA-based PayPal is considered one of the pioneers in the digital payments space. Established in 1998, the company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites and many other commercial users. PayPal has an allocation of 4.51% in the Best Performing Portfolio on TipRanks. Yet, the stock has been a laggard so far this year, declining a massive 59.6%, compared to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index’s decline of 25.9%. Recently, Barclays analyst Ramsey El Assal reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $125, which implies upside potential of 58.7% from current levels. Overall, the Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 27 Buys, five Holds and one Sell. PYPL's average price target of $129.06 implies upside potential of 63.9% from current levels. Shares have declined 68.3% over the past year. TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings, the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into PayPal’s performance this quarter. According to the tool, the PayPal website recorded a 63.47% monthly rise in global visits in April against the same period last year. Further, the footfall on the company's website has grown 105.52% year-to-date, compared to the previous year. Key Takeaways Although the sector has been witnessing a decline in the recent past due to the prevailing uncertainties and the larger sell-off in the technology space, the online payments sector is expected to thrive in the coming years. Consequently, investors can ride this growth by considering the aforementioned stocks, which occupy a notable position among the best performing portfolios on TipRanks and seem to be well-positioned to gain from the ensuing tailwinds in the sector.

1748,"Wall Street experts analyze various macro, sector, and company-specific factors to build their estimates for a company’s quarterly performance. One such aspect that is increasingly being monitored, especially for companies with online sales channels, is their website traffic. Amid increasing digitization and heightened focus on online channels, trends in website traffic help us gauge the interest in a company’s products and service offerings. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1D_7Y40Vec&ab_channel=TomNash TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s largest website usage monitoring service, to provide an estimate of website visits over a particular period. We used this tool to assess the website traffic for PayPal and Domino’s ahead of their first-quarter results.      PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) Shares of payment processing giant PayPal have crashed 53.5% year-to-date. They tanked 25% on February 2 in reaction to mixed Q421 results and weak guidance. PayPal forecast a nearly 29% decline in Q122 adjusted EPS to $0.87 and about a 6% growth in revenue on a spot and foreign exchange-neutral basis. Analysts expect Q122 adjusted EPS to decline 28% to $0.88 and revenue to grow 6.2% to $6.41 billion. The company’s full-year revenue guidance indicated growth of 15%-17%, and adjusted EPS between $4.60-$4.75 compared to $4.60 in 2021. PayPal cited several reasons for a weaker-than-expected outlook, including tough comparisons, a deceleration in e-commerce growth, weakness in consumer spending in its lower-income cohorts due to inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, and the migration of eBay to its own managed payment system.   Ahead of the Q1 print (scheduled for April 27), Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette stated, “While there's a chance PYPL could shift their '22 revenue growth outlook to the low-end of the 15-17% range, as some investors expect, we believe that would be largely related to slower than expected growth in broader ecommerce vs. more PYPL-specific factors.” Faucette reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $190 on PayPal. Overall, the Street is cautiously optimistic about PayPal, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell. The average PayPal price target of $167.86 suggests 91.23% upside potential from current levels.    TipRanks’ Website Traffic tool indicates that in Q122, total estimated visits on the PayPal website grew 125.81% on a year-over-year basis. Also, website traffic increased 20.75% in Q122 compared to Q421. This indicates a slowdown compared to the 23.82% quarterly growth in website traffic seen in Q421.     Domino’s Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) Shares of Domino’s have plunged about 33% so far this year on concerns over a slowdown in business momentum as pandemic tailwinds fade. Last month, the company announced its Q4 FY21 (ended January 2, 2022) results, which missed Wall Street’s expectations. Domino’s Q4 FY21 revenue declined 1% to $1.34 billion due to adverse currency fluctuations and staffing challenges faced by the company’s U.S. operations, particularly in the delivery business. Adjusted EPS grew about 23% to $4.25, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count resulting from the company’s share repurchases.   Domino’s is expected to announce its Q1 FY22 results on April 28. While the company didn’t provide any specific guidance, it stated that it expects Q4 FY21 headwinds to continue in the first quarter. Moreover, increased commodity costs and higher inflation are expected to impact profitability. Analysts expect Q1 FY22 revenue to grow 4.6% to $1.03 billion and adjusted EPS to rise 2.7% to $3.08.    Heading into the Q1 earnings, UBS analyst Dennis Geiger lowered his price target on Domino's to $430 from $475 and maintained a Hold rating. Geiger feels that staffing challenges and macro pressures might have persisted in Q1 and impacted Domino’s sales trends.   That said, Geiger believes that the second half of the year could witness better momentum backed by improved staffing and driver levels coupled with higher pricing.   Overall, Domino’s scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell. The average Domino’s price target of $456.50 implies 20.72% upside potential from current levels. TipRanks' Website Traffic tool indicates that in Q122, total estimated visits on Domino’s website grew 101.22% on a year-over-year basis. Further, website traffic increased 16.07% in Q122 on a quarter-over-quarter basis, marking an improvement from the 7.29% growth seen in Q421, possibly as a result of the Omicron outbreak. Management might shed some light on this in the upcoming conference call. Assessing website traffic data might be beneficial as online ordering has recently gained prominence in the food industry. Over half of Domino’s global retail sales in FY21 came from digital channels. Conclusion While several analysts continue to believe in PayPal’s growth story, they remain cautious due to multiple near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in spending due to inflationary pressures and the impact of geopolitical tensions. TipRanks' Website Traffic Tool indicates a slowdown in Q122 website traffic growth on a sequential basis. Persistent labor challenges, the absence of stimulus packages and unemployment benefits, which boosted consumer demand last year, and inflation are expected to be a drag on Domino’s Q1 FY22 results. Meanwhile, website traffic trends for Q122 look more favorable for Domino’s.    Learn more about the Website Traffic tool in this video by Youtube sensation Tom Nash.  Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust  Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure",2022-04-26

2403,"PayPal (PYPL) stock has clearly fallen out of favor with investors. The shares have shaved off 58% of their value over the past year. The sharp decline has been a reflection of disappointing quarterly results, in which the digital payments giant’s growth has shown to be stuttering. Morgan Stanley’s James Faucette says the “modestly” weaker-than-expected results of the past couple of quarters are down to a range of factors. These include, “uneven/disappointing ecommerce growth from tough year-over-year comparisons, the Omicron-variant, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and stimulus impacts.” Indirect hits to consumer spend due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis will most probably continue to impact ecommerce metrics in 1Q22. However, while Faucette thinks patience is of the essence here, his long-term bull thesis remains intact. “With eventual ecommerce normalization, we think the market will better appreciate the strong underlying fundamentals of PYPL's business,” the 5-star analyst wrote. Faucette’s comments come following a fireside chat with CEO Dan Schulman, at the banking firm’s annual TMT (Tech, Media, and Telecom) Conference. There, Schulman made reassuring noises on the fundamental drivers of the business, such as average revenue per user, gross user additions, engagement growth and additional e-commerce and digital wallet share gains. Schulman also highlighted the increasing use of the platform; customers were using PayPal 17 times per year when he joined the company 7.5 years ago, but that has risen to 45 times per year now. The CEO attributed the increase to newly rolled out services such as BNPL (buy now, pay later). There are also other reasons to believe shopping at PYPL merchants should continue to increase. Along with growing merchant acceptance, these include Venmo’s upcoming addition to Amazon, offline channels’ (iZettle) recent growth, the ability to pay bills and crypto payments. “This, combined with broader financial service offerings such as high-yield savings accounts and the potential for more BNPL financing products position PYPL to show good compounding growth of 20% growth exiting 2022,” the analyst summed up. Good news for PayPal, then, but what does it all mean for investors? Acknowledging the strength of the company’s forward plans, Faucette rates PayPal shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $190 price target suggests an upside of ~93% for the year ahead. (To watch Faucette’s track record, click here) Overall, 37 analysts have recently reviewed PayPal’s prospects, of which 26 say Buy, 10 recommend to Hold and 1 implores to sell, all adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target is hardly less bullish than Nowak allows; at $182.36, the figure suggests shares will climb 85% higher in the year ahead.

3224,"Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  is expected to report strong fourth-quarter 2021 earnings results after the market closes on February 1, based on monthly users statistics.



For a digital payments firms like PayPal, total website visits are a strong indicator of user involvement on PayPal's platform. The more people visit PayPal's website, the more money the corporation may generate through transaction fees, interchange fees, cash interest, and other sources.



Therefore, we turned to TipRanks' new tool, which records monthly and quarterly website visits, to learn more about PayPal's performance ahead of Q4. The data for Paypal's core platform revealed a clear upward trend, signaling a strong quarter ahead.



The graph below shows that the total estimated visits to paypal.com grew during the quarter to be reported. More specifically, we observed that total visits to paypal.com increased by 10.35% sequentially to 1.8 billion.







In addition, the tool shows that PayPal's other subsidiaries, such as Honey, Venmo, Xoom, and Braintree, have also seen an increase in user visits on a sequential basis in Q4. More precisely, total projected visits to joinhoney.com, venmo.com, xoom.com, and braintreepayments.com increased by 24.5%, 2.7%, 3.4%, and 26.2%, respectively, on a sequential basis.



This total quarterly rise suggests robust transactional activity on Paypal’s platform. Also, PayPal's key metrics, such as total payment volume (TPV), active customer accounts, and a total number of payment transactions, may have improved in the fourth quarter, favorably boosting the company's revenue in the fourth quarter.



On a less positive note, we noticed that the total estimated visits to paypal.com are down 1.93% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, dampening the Q4 euphoria to some extent. However, this year-over-year drop should not be a reason for concern, as no company-specific issues have been detected.







To conclude, the overall monthly user figures point to a high likelihood of significant revenue growth for PayPal in Q4. The customers' shifting preferences toward contactless payments in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic could be attributed as a big factor in the growing website visits to PayPal.



Experts’ Take



Ahead of the PayPal earnings release, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer maintained a Buy rating on PayPal but decreased the price target to $270 from $345 per share.



PayPal also has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street analysts, with 27 Buys, 6 Holds, and only 1 Sell. The PayPal stock projections indicate an average price target of $252.25, suggesting a possible 12-month upside of 60.7%.

3551,"Paypal Holdings (PYPL) plans to strengthen its foothold in the burgeoning cryptocurrency space by launching a stablecoin. Bloomberg reports that the payment giant is exploring the launch after evidence of a “PayPal Coin” was found inside the company’s iPhone App. PYPL shares fell 2.43% to close at $187.6 on January 7.



PayPal is a digital payments company that allows people to send and receive payments. Some of its notable solutions include PayPal, Paypal Credit, and Venmo. PayPal's earnings report for Q4 2021 is scheduled for February 02, 2022.



PayPal Coin



The company has already confirmed it is working closely with the relevant regulators as part of the Stablecoin push. Hidden code and images in the iPhone app show that the company is working on a “PayPal Coin” backed by the U.S. dollar.



However, a PayPal spokeswoman insists that the images and codes seen inside the PayPal iPhone app resulted from the recent internal hackathon. The event brings engineers together to build new products, some of which never see a public release.



PayPal is one of the companies that have strengthened its footprint in the cryptocurrency space. The company has launched new features on its apps that allow people to buy and hold digital coins. It has also made it possible for people to use their crypto holdings to pay for purchases.



However, it is not the first technology company to explore the possibility of coming up with a stablecoin. Meta Platforms has been working on a stablecoin dubbed Diem. Visa has also allowed a stablecoin to settle a transaction on its network.



Stock Rating



Last week, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham upgraded PayPal stock to a Buy from a Hold with a $224 price target, implying 19.40% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, payment stocks are set up constructively for the year.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 27 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average PayPal price target of $266.80 implies 42.22% upside potential to current levels.

3659,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock has been on the receiving end of the recent fintech sell-off. Undoubtedly, the fintech corner of the tech scene became that much more crowded in 2021, with a wide range of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) firms moving into the spotlight. 



For now, I am neutral on PayPal stock. Many negatives are baked in and there's a lot of room to the upside if management can change course. That said, competitive pressures could continue to act as a thorn in the side of a firm whose best growth days may be behind it.



Can PayPal Weather the BNPL Storm?



Afterpay, Affirm (AFRM), Sezzle, and Paybright are just a few of the firms that are willing to offer the consumer a better deal to disrupt the payments space. Incumbent firms reliant on their high fees are completely right to be concerned. 



Still, one has to wonder whether the interest-free installments offered by the BNPL firms will be in jeopardy once rates begin to rise.



The million-dollar question in 2022 will be if consumers stick with the BNPL firms after the U.S. Federal Reserve moves forward with its promised trio of rate hikes in the new year. 



Are the consumers BNPL firms won during these past few years stickier than they seem? Or will they jump back to the old-school payments companies like PayPal once interest-free payments are a thing of the past?



Only time will tell. In any case, PayPal isn't the only game in town anymore and investors should re-evaluate the changing landscape before buying the dip in PYPL stock, even though shares seem to scream of value after nearly getting slashed in half. 



Fortunately, PayPal's BNPL offering has been met with great success, with usage soaring almost 400% during Black Friday 2021.



With rising competition in the broader payments space, PayPal's margins may be pressured, even as rates begin to lift off the floor.



PYPL Stock: What About Valuation?



Arguably, the credit card companies and high-multiple fintech plays deserve to take a hit to the chin. PayPal stock got knocked down around 42% off its peak of around $308 per share. 



Although PayPal still has a lot of growth left in the tank, it's worth noting that the valuation got out of hand earlier in the year, as investors got overexuberant about what was an incredible 2020 for online sales growth.



Despite the magnitude of the decline, PYPL stock is still no bargain at over 45 times trailing earnings and 9.1 times sales. If PayPal can re-accelerate its growth in the new year, shares of PYPL could easily correct upwards. With all the competition moving into the fintech space, though, it's hard to get behind the name. 



Competition



It's not just the rise of BNPL that could apply the pressure, but disruptors in the FAANG cohort could also make a bigger splash in the payments space, specifically Apple (AAPL) with its Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. 



Further, the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) trend and other up-and-comers like SoFi Technologies (SOFI) could take a stride out of PayPal's growth prospects and margins if it can't continue to innovate while offering its users a better value proposition. 



To offer more competitive fees while investing to stay on the cutting edge of innovation, profitability prospects are bound to take a hit at a time when the market is turning its back against the high-growth companies that promise most of their profits way into the future.



As such, PayPal will need to stay on its toes. In any case, a more competitive environment is not a great place to be in as an investor.



Wall Street's Take



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PYPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 32 analyst ratings, there are 26 Buy recommendations, five Hold recommendations and one Sell recommendation.



The average PayPal price target is $270.87. Analyst price targets range from a low of $190 per share to a high of $342 per share.







The Bottom Line on PayPal Stock



PayPal is a magnificent company that's fallen on hard times. 



With growth showing signs of weakening, the stakes are as high as ever. Sure, comparables were unfavourable and the firm continues to move on from its days of partnering with eBay (EBAY). 



That said, it's tough to gauge how much of recent pressure on revenue growth is poised to reverse and how much will worsen at the hands of rivals.



While the consumer spending environment could improve in 2022, competitive pressures could easily mount, as they look to steal PayPal's share of the pie. 



Don't think that PayPal can't put up a fight, though. It has a seasoned management team that could have some solutions up its sleeves. In any case, 2022 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for the fintech giant.

3677,"PayPal (PYPL) is a technology platform and app that enables digital and mobile payments. I am bullish on the stock.



After sliding from $300 to $200 in 2021's second half, PYPL stock might seem like a lost cause. Yet, while some folks might see the glass as half-empty, others will view it as half-full.



As we'll see, Wall Street is mostly bullish on PayPal. However, one analyst offers a word of caution on PYPL stock.



Still, the company's top executive isn't worried about PayPal's future prospects. Indeed, there are data points to show that the company might be on the cusp of a turnaround. 



Likely to Get Worse?



In order to understand both sides of the issue, it's important to see what a less optimistic Wall Street expert has to say about PayPal.



Not long ago, Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri lowered his price target on PYPL stock from $240 to $220. It's not a massive cut, but Katri's opinion is still worth taking into consideration.



Evidently, the analyst is concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on consumer spending and travel weighing on PYPL stock next year.



Katri cited “uninspiring” Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, along with a broader “retail data miss.” With those issues in mind, Katri expects things to “likely get worse” before they get better.



Also, the Wedbush analyst is concerned about inflation driving up the price of goods and thereby scaring consumers into saving instead of spending.



Delivering the Numbers



Only time will tell whether high inflation persists into 2022, and whether the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on consumer spending.



Katri's concerns might turn out to be overstated, and if that's the case then PYPL stock should be poised for a rebound.



For his part, PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman doesn't seem overly concerned about his company's prospects for 2022.



Schulman had some data points to back up his bullish stance. For one thing, digital sales at the start of 2021's holiday shopping season were flat this year, after rising by 50% last year.



That might not sound like good news, but check this out. Retail sales fell 26% from their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This suggests that online shopping is here to stay - and of course, that's great for PayPal.



Furthermore, PayPal forecast 55 million net-new active users for 2021, and according to Schulman, the company is on target to deliver that number. Impressively, PayPal is expected to meet the target of 750 million total users by the year 2025.



Not only that, but buy-now, pay-later sales were up 400% year-over-year on Black Friday. Schulman asserts that PayPal is one of the top four buy-now, pay-later players in the world.



Wall Street’s Take







According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PYPL is a Strong Buy, based on 26 Buy, five Hold, and one Sell ratings. The average PayPal price target is $270.87, implying 41% upside potential.



The Takeaway



Clearly, not every Wall Street expert likes PayPal's prospects for 2022. However, the majority of the analysts give PYPL stock a Strong Buy rating.



Moreover, PayPal's CEO is clearly optimistic about his company, and there's data to back up his bullish stance.



Thus, PYPL stock might turn a corner very soon, as the next year is likely to be a strong one for this digital payments contender.

Management’s cautious stance amid supply-chain disruptions, a tight labor market, and eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) payment migration took a toll on its stock price. 



What Lies Ahead



Uneven consumer spending and supply-chain disruptions amid the pandemic could continue to pose challenges for PayPal in the near term. Meanwhile, Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities lowered PayPal’s price target citing a slowdown in e-commerce and risks in the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) segment.



Dolev also lowered PayPal’s estimates for 2022-23 on moderation in e-commerce concerns and continued take rate pressures. While Dolev noted that PayPal’s “GPV (gross payments volumes) is still small, PYPL is still visible in this space given the size of its user base,” which “could drive perception concerns as BNPL comes under more scrutiny.”



Nevertheless, Dolev maintained a bullish outlook on PayPal. The analyst noted that despite its exposure to the BNPL market, PayPal’s business remains well-diversified.



Along with Dolev, UBS analyst Rayna Kumar is also bullish on PayPal and views the pullback as a buying opportunity. 



Further, TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool indicates that investors have been accumulating PayPal stock on weakness. The data shows that 7% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have increased their stakes in PayPal in the past month.



Wall Street’s Take



Wall Street is bullish about PayPal stock. On TipRanks, PayPal has received 26 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. 



Further, PayPal’s stock forecast and price targets on TipRanks show solid upside due to the recent pullback in its price. The average PayPal price target of $270.87 indicates 48.3% upside potential to current levels.

Case in point, Lightspeed (LSPD) and Nuvei (NVEI) have both been targeted by short sellers and their stocks are down by over 50% from 52-week highs. The impacts are having ripple effects across the industry and even the blue chips are seeing notable declines as retail investors get spooked.



A good example of this is Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) which has lost 3.8% over the past month and is now trading at a 41% discount to 52-week highs. Where others panic, I see opportunity and am bullish on Paypal's stock.



Leading Fintech Company



Paypal is arguably the most well-known fintech company. It was spun out of eBay (EBAY) back in 2015 and has grown into one of the largest payment solutions companies in the world. The company has more than 400 million active accounts and operates in more than 200 markets.



Over the years, Paypal has expanded its reach through strategic acquisitions and has amassed an impressive portfolio of brands. These include Venmo, Xoom, Simility, Honey, Paidy, Hyperwallet, and Braintree, among others.



For the past 20 years, the company has been at the forefront of digital payments innovation and the company is well positioned to be a leader over the next 20.



Mixed Q3 Results



In early November, Paypal announced mixed Q3 2021 results. While earnings of $1.11 per share beat estimates by $0.03, revenue of $6.1 billion came in $50 million lighter than expected. In the quarter, it added 13.3 million net active accounts and exited Q3 with 416 million.



Year-over-year, the company experienced healthy growth, as evidenced by the numbers below.



Revenue +13.2%,EPS: +4%Free Cash Flow: +20%Total Payment Volume (TPV): 24%



The company also announced that Venmo users in the U.S. would be able to use the platform on Amazon (AMZN) starting in 2022.



""We’re thrilled that we are teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout,"" said a release.



The news could prove to be material as Venmo has over 80 million users in the U.S., and it processed close to $60 billion in TPV, up 36% year-over-year.



Unfortunately, what was an otherwise solid quarter was overshadowed by weak guidance. Paypal expects revenue of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion, and upcoming earnings of $1.12 per share in Q4 2021. This compares to analysts' average estimates of $7.24 billion and $1.28, respectively.



When a company misses guidance, the company’s stock usually reacts to the downside. Not surprisingly, Paypal closed the day down 10.4% from its pre-earnings day close. Couple the disappointed quarter with the subsequent short attacks on LSPD and NVEI, and Paypal’s stock price has struggled to gain any momentum since.



The good news is that now might be the perfect entry point for those looking to add Paypal to their portfolio. The company is trading at a discount to historical averages.



Wall Street’s Take



From Wall Street analysts, Paypal earns a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 25 Buy ratings, five Hold ratings, and only one Sell rating.



The average Paypal price target of $270.87 puts the upside potential at 48.4%.

Strong Numbers



PayPal reported strong numbers for Q3 2021 earnings. Total payment volume (TPV) hit $310 billion, while its net revenue was $6.18 billion. These numbers have grown by 26% and 24% year-on-year, respectively. 



The company has 416 million active accounts, thanks to a net addition of 13.3 million new active accounts in the quarter. It also generated $1.3 billion in cash flow.



Every active account conducts 44.2 transactions a month. This represents an increase of 10% year-over-year. The company added over 1.2 million merchant accounts on its platform. 



Its P2P (peer-to-peer) volume, including PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom, was up 24% at $92 billion, representing 30% of TPV. Venmo was the biggest contributor, surging 36% to $60 billion. eBay Marketplaces TPV declined 46% and accounted for only 3% of TPV. Merchant Services TPV, excluding eBay Marketplaces, grew by 30%.



The company said it expects to end Fiscal Year 2021 with revenue growth of around 18% in Q4 and over 430 million active accounts (including around 3 million accounts after its acquisition of Paidy). Net revenue is expected to come in the range of $25.3 billion to $25.4 billion. 



Betting on Buy Now Pay Later



PayPal continues to grow its Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) footprint, which has an over $8.0 billion TPV run rate. Its services are available in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It will expand to Spain and Italy in Q4.



It completed its acquisition of BNPL platform and provider Paidy in Japan on October 13, 2021, for $2.7 billion. It has also eliminated late charges for its BNPL customers from October 1.



A lot of fintech companies believe that BNPL is the big growth engine of the future. An example of this is when Block, formerly known as Square (SQ), acquired AfterPay for $29 billion in August 2021.



The Bull Case for PayPal



While PayPal stock has taken a hit in 2021, the bull case for the stock is not going anywhere. To get an indication of the utility value of the company, one only needs to take a look at its numbers for Giving Tuesday in 2021. 



A release said, ""PayPal today announced that it processed a record-breaking $188 million globally this Giving Tuesday, the largest amount raised on the platform for the global day of giving since Giving Tuesday's inception in 2012. More than 1.6 million PayPal customers across 193 markets donated to causes they care about, amounting to over 2.1 million donations in total.""



One reason the stock has fallen could be that PayPal isn't growing as fast as it could. However, logically, it can't. It is not the same company it was 10 years back. It started life as a payment solution provider for eBay. Today, eBay is a small contributor to its revenues. 



PayPal is one of the largest fintech players in the world. Its P2P product Venmo is one of the fastest-growing ones and even received a spot in Marvel's Shang Chi. The company's partnership with Amazon (Venmo users in the U.S. will be able to pay with Venmo on Amazon.com starting in 2022) and the Paidy acquisition in Japan should serve it well in the years to come.



Perhaps, the company's acquisition of Honey Science Corporation, announced in 2019, was one of the most important decisions in its lifespan. Honey is a deal-finding and rewards program for consumers. This move gave PayPal the ability to become part of the customer's shopping journey from the get-go instead of trying to convince them to use it as a preferred checkout tool at the end of their journey. 



This line on Honey's website sums it up well: ""This means we will be able to make it even easier to search for great discounts when shopping online.""



The Crypto Move



In September, Square's Cash App announced that it had over 70 million transacting users, just 10 million short of Venmo's 80 million. A major reason for Cash App's popularity is that it allowed crypto trading on its platform.



While PayPal has been a little slower than Square in this segment, it hasn't been sitting idle. In late 2020, it launched its cryptocurrency trading platform. Its customers can also use cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and others, with merchants who accept the asset. In April of this year, the company also launched crypto services on Venmo.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, PYPL earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, five Holds, and only one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. 



The average PayPal price target is $272.62, which indicates 41.9% upside potential. The highest forecast for PYPL is $342 which is a potential upside of almost 86%.







Conclusion



PayPal remains one of the leading growth stocks in the current market. I believe the recent drop should be viewed as a buying opportunity.

3789,"It has been a rough stretch for PayPal (PYPL) stock. The share price currently sits almost 40% below the all-time high achieved in July, marking the pullback as the biggest decline since being spun off from eBay in 2015.



The lackluster performance is due to a combination of factors, including a mixed Q3 report and tech stocks getting hit hard in the currently volatile environment.



The stock might be underperforming but going by comments made by management in a recent meeting with Wolfe Research analyst Darrin Peller, the company appears confident it will meet its mid-term targets.



PayPal is aiming for 2025 revenue of “at least” $50 billion. It plans on reaching the goal via a “variety of paths around higher user counts and/or engagement.” Given customers choose to use PayPal only 50% of the time when available, CFO John Rainey noted there’s a lot of room to “increase its share of checkout” with its customers.



The company also has an “aspirational” target of 750 million NNAs (Net New Active Accounts) and noted that the “underlying growth assumptions” of 15% year-over-year, are compatible with NNAs’ growth seen over the last few years.



In the here and now, Rainey noted that Q4 trends started out “relatively strong.” A look at PayPal’s website traffic data confirms this take. Unique visitors between September and October increased by 4.49% from 231.3 million to 241.7 million and shot up even more between October and November – to 259.3 million, amounting to a 7.27% sequential uptick. The company has put the strong showing so far down to holiday shopping starting earlier than usual due to fears around the ongoing supply chain issues.



“Overall,” said the 5-star analyst, “Management continues to see the quarter shaping up to be in-line relative to guidance issued at its earnings call last month.”



Looking ahead to next year, in 1H22, the company expects to still see some “lapping impacts from eBay” – starting in June 2021, eBay began paying sellers directly rather than through PayPal - but that it should see out 2022 at a revenue growth rate “at or above its medium-term guide.”



Down to the nitty-gritty then, what does it all mean for investors? Peller reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating for PYPL stock and has a $250 price target for the shares, suggesting they will move 34% higher over the coming months. (To watch Peller’s track record, click here)



Looking at the consensus breakdown, based on 25 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Strong Buy. Moreover, the forecast calls for one-year gains of 47%, given the average price target clocks in at $274.34. (See PayPal stock forecast on TipRanks)

3790,"I am bullish on PayPal Holdings (PYPL) because revenue will likely continue growing, and the company continues using acquisitions as a key strategy for growth. Furthermore, PayPal issued public debt for the first time in 2020, and investors should see this as an accelerant. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Company Overview



PayPal is a digital payment platform. Its solutions include PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, iZettle, and Hyperwallet products. The company was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA.



Future Outlook



In 2020, PayPal tapped into the public debt market and raised $5 billion. Half of the capital was used to pay down previous debt, and the other half was designated for acquisitions. In 2020, the company saw 21% revenue growth, with growth in 2021 expected to be between 18% - 19%.



As effects from COVID-19 diminish and growth rates in the e-commerce space taper, PayPal’s revenue growth will likely experience a similar decline. While words such as “decline” and “taper” are often linked with poor performance, the company is still growing its revenues at an incredible rate. 



Fueled by acquisitions and additional users, PayPal will likely see over 40 million users added by the end of the year. One of the stars in PayPal’s lineup is Venmo. Venmo’s total payment volume grew 36% year-over-year in Q3. While this is lower than its second-quarter growth rate of 58%, Venmo continues to bolster PayPal’s growth. 



Acquisitions are a key element to the company’s growth. Recently, the company completed its acquisition of Paidy. Paidy is a two-sided payments platform in Japan. With Japan being the third-largest e-commerce market globally, Paidy represents an expansion into further established markets. It also extends the reach of PayPal and its buy now, pay later solution and continues PayPals relevance in the Japanese payments market. 



Based on the recent revenue growth through the pandemic, I estimate growth of approximately 18% through 2022 as the e-commerce market normalizes. Though the decrease in revenue growth is likely inevitable, PayPal’s investment into markets abroad through acquisitions solidifies its long-term growth strategy. 



Company Financials



Moving to the financial statements, PayPal has a healthy balance sheet with enough short-term assets to cover its short and long-term liabilities combined. The company holds $13.3 billion in cash and only $8.9 billion in debt. 



The company’s revenues grew at a compound annual growth rate of 17.81% from 2014 to 2020, and net margins improved from 12.74% in 2015 to 20.09% in 2020. As revenues grow and margins improve, PayPal becomes more and more profitable. The price-to-earnings ratio rose considerably to a peak of 79.9x in 2020 but has since fallen to 45.3x, the lowest level since 2017.



Valuation



Using a discounted cash flow analysis, investors can see that there is a lot of upside potential. The calculation used in this analysis indicates revenues will hit just under $100 billion by 2030, representing 14.66% average growth annually. Cash flows in the analysis grow at a rate of 11.22% to $18.81 billion over the same timeframe. Capital expenditures are also forecasted to grow significantly. 



After discounting the future cash flows by the current weighted average cost of capital of 6.5%, the value of future cash flows indicates a fair value stock price of $309.



Risks



PayPal is growing significantly but is also highly correlated with economic activity. If the world economy experiences a slowdown, PayPal will see negative impacts resulting from fewer transactions.



The digital payment market is highly competitive. Another risk to the company is other competitors in the space finding innovative solutions and gaining market share. While competition is always a risk, PayPal is positioned well to find talent through acquisitions of start-ups and other companies innovating in the digital payment space.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, PayPal has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 25 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $272.62, the average PayPal price target implies 46.8% upside potential.







Final Thoughts



PayPal’s platform is a widely used and popular payment processing tool. With the e-commerce market growing and digital payments surpassing cash payments, the company is a top contender in its space. 



Although there are overall risks of market downturns and economic slowdowns, Paypal is a well-run company with excellent financial management. I reiterate my bullish sentiment and anticipate price growth over the next year.

California-based Paypal is a digital payments platform with operations in the majority of the countries. Its solutions include PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet.



The company’s shares closed 1.7% lower on Friday. They were trading 1.5% down, at the time of writing, in the pre-market trading session on Monday.



CEO Comments



“We saw a 400% year-on-year rise on our volumes going through 'buy now, pay later' this past Black Friday. It’s booming right now,” Schulman said.



“We had more than one million first-time users for the first time ever in the month of November. It's not just popular but accelerating in popularity,” he added.



The company launched its ‘Buy in 4’ platform in August 2020.



Wall Street’s Take



Last month, Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat downgraded the rating on the stock to Hold from Buy with a price target of $220 (19.6% upside potential).



In a note to investors, the analyst said, “It is an understatement to say that the payments landscape is rapidly evolving with many powerful trends emerging. While PayPal is actively investing and evolving, it simply has more turf to defend versus peers in our view.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. The average Paypal Holdings price target of $276.07 implies 50.1% upside potential. Shares have lost 29.4% over the past six months.



Website Traffic



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Paypal’s performance.



According to the tool, compared to the previous year, the company’s website traffic registered a 3.5% decrease in global visits in October. However, the website traffic has increased 5.3% year-to-date against the same period last year.

3909,"PayPal (PYPL) is a technology platform and app that enables digital and mobile payments. I am bullish on the stock.



Over the past two decades, PayPal has been a major competitor in the digital payments space.



Yet, Wall Street doesn't seem to appreciate PayPal's contribution to the modern economy. As we'll see, one big-name analyst, in particular, doesn't seem too impressed with PayPal lately.



Moreover, PYPL stock has been on a downtrend recently. Nonetheless, there may be a prime buying opportunity for contrarian investors here. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



A Quick Look at PYPL Stock



From a technical standpoint, there's definitely been damage done to PYPL stock.



The stock started 2021 with a bang at $200 and moved up rapidly early in the year.



However, PYPL stock ended up hitting the same $309 resistance level twice – first in February and then again in July.



That price point proved to be an ideal place to take profits, as the PayPal share price tanked in late July and kept on falling through the end of November.



With PYPL stock currently in the mid $180's, value hunters should be eager to own some shares.



After all, the share price decline brought PayPal's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio down to 45x, which is relatively low for this company.



Not the Worst Downgrade



Investors should be on the lookout for analysts' upgrades and downgrades on their favorite stocks - no doubt about that.



On the other hand, it's essential to be aware of the nuances within those upgrades and downgrades.



Some downgrades are quite harsh, while others aren't all that bad. Consider, for example, Bernstein's recent downgrade of PayPal.



Reportedly, the analyst firm cut its rating on PYPL stock from ""outperform"" to ""market perform."" That's not the worst downgrade I've ever seen, by a long shot.



Also, Bernstein reduced its price target on the stock from $260 to $220 per share. Heck, that's still above where it's currently trading, so apparently, there's still room for upside.



Supposedly, the Bernstein analysts are concerned that PayPal is suffering a potential death ""from a thousand cuts"" because rival payments companies are eating away at PayPal's business.



Still a Thriving Business



Sure, there's competition in the digital payments space.



Yet, this doesn't mean that PayPal's business isn't able to flourish amid the competition.



Just check the data: in Q3 2021, PayPal earned an adjusted $1.11 per share, while Wall Street was only expecting $1.07 per share.



During that same time frame, PayPal generated $6.18 billion in revenues - not too shabby.



With that in mind, perhaps investors should listen to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer.



He recently encouraged investors to ""strongly consider buying the dip"" on beaten-down names like PayPal as they look for stock-picking opportunities amid the ""fintech equity carnage.""



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, PYPL earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating. The average PayPal price target is $276.07, implying 47.5% upside potential.







The Takeaway



Some analysts will like PayPal now, while others won't.



Plus, PayPal has stiff competition - there's no denying it.



However, PayPal has demonstrated that the company is still quite capable of generating strong revenues and profits.



Therefore, it's likely a great time for contrarian investors to go bargain-shopping with PYPL stock.

3959,"Despite the ongoing shift towards the digital economy, 2021 has proven to be a challenging year for PayPal (PYPL).



Shares of this financial technology company are down about 21% on a year-to-date basis compared to 22.4% growth in the Nasdaq composite index. 



PayPal’s underperformance stems from tough year-over-year comparisons, eBay’s (EBAY) payment migration, and management’s cautious outlook. PayPal’s management expects tight labor market and retail supply chain disruptions to negatively impact holiday sales and its financial performance.  



Now What?



While PayPal stock underperformed the market averages this year, could 2022 change its course?



UBS analyst Rayna Kumar initiated coverage on PayPal stock with a bullish outlook. She stated that the recent selloff in PayPal stock represents an opportunity to buy. 



It’s worth noting that PayPal struck a deal with Amazon (AMZN) that would enable American consumers to shop on Amazon with PayPal’s Venmo account. In response to the deal, PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, stated that Amazon’s large market share will significantly boost “the addressable market for Pay with Venmo.” 



He added that “Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward.”



Besides the Amazon deal, the acquisition of Paidy and the rapid adoption of PayPal’s BNPL (buy now pay later) offering bodes well for future growth. PayPal stated that since the launch of its BNPL offerings, it has processed $5.4 billion in TPV (total payment volume). Meanwhile, PayPal plans to expand its global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022.



Further, PayPal stock has positive indicators from insiders and investors. TipRanks’ insider trading activity tool shows that insiders bought $2.3 million worth of its shares in the past three months. Meanwhile, about 10.5% of investors who hold portfolios on TipRanks have raised their exposure to PayPal stock in the last 30 days.



Wall Street’s Take



Wall Street analysts continue to show confidence in PayPal stock. On TipRanks, PayPal sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average PayPal price target of $276.04 implies 49.3% upside potential to current levels.



Moreover, PayPal stock scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score system, indicating that it could outperform market averages.

4000,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) stock has reversed viciously in recent months, now down around 40% from its July peak. 



With the latest analyst downgrade by Bernstein, who sees the firm being on the receiving end of increasing competition, more salt has been rubbed in the wounds of the fintech giant.



Despite the Bernstein downgrade, most analysts remain incredibly bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target just north of $276, implying around 47% upside from current levels. I am neutral on the stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Queue More Downgrades?



The real question that should be on investors' minds is if further downgrades will ensue, as upside potential starts to become unrealistic. Indeed, further downgrades could cause a considerable amount of downside, potentially back to the $123 pre-pandemic range.



Increasing competition is never a good thing, but the width of PayPal's moat should not be discounted. The company has a lot of levers to pull to maintain its spot atop fintech. Still, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) firms are hungry, and they pose a severe threat to incumbent players like PayPal.



Moreover, a fintech first-mover has been able to command lofty fees for its services. As the space gets that much more crowded, downward pressure is due to be applied to such fees. 



A questionable trajectory of margins moving forward and evidence of slowed growth in the latest (third) quarter does not bode well for the company, especially as pandemic tailwinds continue to fade.



PayPal is up against it, but most of such pain has likely already been baked into the share price. A 40% peak-to-trough decline is nothing to sneeze at. After such a plunge, PayPal stock trades at 9.1 times sales, making it a compelling value option in a crowded arena.



Perhaps partnerships -- think Venmo joining forces with Amazon (AMZN) -- can help alleviate competitive pressures by up-and-coming financial disruptors. Still, at the end of the day, if PayPal can't innovate and gain ground on its hungry peers, it will ultimately lose share.



For the third quarter, total payment volume rose 24% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Revenue came in at $6.2 billion with per-share earnings of $1.11, a slight beat over the consensus estimate, which called for $1.07. Although the quarter was quite strong, the modest slowing of growth was enough for investors to flee. 



BNPL to Weather the Storm?



BNPL firms like Affirm (AFRM) are pressuring the incumbents in a big way. PayPal is just another company that's jumping aboard the BNPL bandwagon alongside the likes of major credit card companies that have already fallen under considerable selling pressure in recent quarters.



While PayPal's version of BNPL will help alleviate disruptive pressures, it will be tough to play catch up, as the landscape continues shifting. Not to mention behemoths like Apple (AAPL) could pressure PayPal right where it hurts: the wallet.



Apple Wallet is getting better, and one has to think a PayPal-like offering would also complement its Apple Card offering very well. As innovative a company as PayPal is, management's target of 20% in annual revenue growth over five years could be at risk if PayPal can't retain its customers, many of whom will be enticed to switch to another platform for their payments. 



Wall Street's Take



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PYPL stock comes in as a Buy. Out of 30 analyst ratings, there are 24 Buy recommendations, five Hold recommendations and one Sell recommendation.



The average PayPal price target is $276.04. Analyst price targets range from a low of $190 per share to a high of $342 per share.







Bottom Line



For now, PayPal's future is hazy. A wave of analyst downgrades could apply even more selling pressure on the stock as the implied upside moves further out of reach.

4011,"PayPal (PYPL) is a technology platform and app that enables digital and mobile payments. I am bullish on the stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



For years, PayPal has been a pivotal part of the global shift towards app-based payments.



The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated this shift, and both merchants and customers have increasingly turned to PayPal for convenient mobile payments.



However, investors have sold off PYPL stock in 2021.



Does the stock deserve this treatment on Wall Street? Let's delve into the data and see if there's actually a bargain here.



A Quick Look at PYPL Stock



PYPL stock started 2021 at $200, and it embarked upon a sharp rally early in the year. Interestingly, the stock hit the same resistance level of $305 twice - first in February and then again in July.



This means that cautious investors could consider taking profits, either partially or entirely, if PYPL stock returns to $305.



Starting in July, the stock started tanking. By mid-to-late November, it was trading near $190. Therefore, investors have a chance to buy PYPL stock at a price below where it was at the beginning of 2021.



Yet, we must investigate why the stock may have declined so sharply in recent weeks.



Showing Solid Growth



Given PayPal's recently reported fiscal data, you'd think that PYPL stock should be much higher than it is today.



Consider the company's total payment volume (TPV) for 2021's third quarter. TPV is basically the lifeblood of a company in the payments niche, where PayPal operates.



In Q3, PayPal's TPV reached $310 billion with 416 million active accounts. Compared to the $247 billion in TPV for Q3 of 2020, this represents an increase of 24% - not too shabby. Also, during 2021's third quarter, PayPal generated net revenue of $6.18 billion, signifying a 13% year-over-year improvement.



PayPal President and CEO, Dan Schulman, celebrated a quarter that was truly outstanding for his company. ""Our third-quarter results show solid growth on top of a record year,"" Schulman commented.



A Thousand Cuts



Despite PayPal's excellent financial performance, not everyone is bullish on PYPL stock. For example, Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat, recently downgraded the stock from an outperform rating to market perform.



Rawat's concerns about PayPal might help to clarify why investors have been selling PYPL stock lately. Apparently, Rawat is concerned about the ""increasing aggregation"" of e-commerce activity on other platforms. In other words, PayPal has competition.



To that, we can respond by observing the aforementioned growth in PayPal's TPV and active accounts. Rawat believes that PayPal's market-share gains could slow ""by a thousand cuts.""



There will always be competition in the digital payments space. Yet, the data indicates that PayPal remains in growth mode.



Wall Street’s Take







Turning to Wall Street, PayPal has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 24 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average PayPal price target is $276.04, implying 48.4% upside potential.



The Takeaway



Some investors, and even analysts, might be concerned about Paypal's competition in the digital payments market. However, this has been a concern for quite a while, and Paypal has just kept on growing as a business.



So, after a share-price decline possibly based on an overreaction, PYPL stock looks like a bargain now.

4101,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a digital payments platform, having a wide range of financial products such as PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, iZettle, and Hyperwallet that allow its customers to send and receive payments online.



PayPal has many highly positive financial metrics, such as robust revenue and EPS growth in the past five years, consistent positive free cash flows, and a strong balance sheet. 



Shares of PayPal have underperformed year-to-date in 2021, with losses of over 12%. With a current stock price of around $205, I am bearish on PYPL stock; the key factor is its lofty valuation. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



I am also bearish because I'm not convinced that the wider adoption of cryptocurrency as a means of digital payment that PayPal supports will support its expansion plans.



Business News: New Partnership, Rumors Of Buying Pinterest



PayPal's management has been active lately, with a plethora of news released about its business operations and updates on its plans. One very positive piece of information is a new partnership with Amazon (AMZN), allowing Venmo users to use the service and pay on Amazon's e-commerce platform.



In early September 2021, PayPal announced that it has agreed to acquire Paidy, ""a leading two-sided payments platform and provider of buy now, pay later solutions in Japan, for ¥300 billion or approximately US$2.7 billion, principally in cash. The acquisition will expand PayPal's capabilities, distribution, and relevance in the domestic payments market in Japan, the third-largest e-commerce market in the world, complementing the company's existing cross-border e-commerce business in the country.""



This is positive news as PayPal has plenty of cash to pursue such strategic business acquisitions. What is interesting news, though, is the announcement PayPal made to put an end to rumors that it was interested in buying Pinterest (PINS). In a very short press release, PayPal stated that ""in response to market rumors regarding a potential acquisition of Pinterest by PayPal, PayPal stated that it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time.""



Why not at this time? Why pursue to acquire Pinterest after all? Pinterest is a social media company. Could this be a hint that PayPal is exploring diversified investments? Or, has PayPal identified that Pinterest has a significant user base that seems a good fit to use its digital payment services and support its revenue growth? 



We may find out in the next few quarters, although an explanation may be that PayPal could not make this acquisition paying in all cash at this time. It would have to be a combination of cash and stock. This is because in the Q3 2021 results, the cash, cash equivalents, and investments reported on PayPal's balance sheet were $20 billion, which is far below the $45 billion needed to acquire Pinterest at a rumored price of $70 per share. Even now, Pinterest's market cap is around $31 billion at $48 per share.



Q3 2021 Results: Strong, but Mixed



The Q3 2021 results were a beat on earnings but a miss on revenue.



PayPal earned an adjusted $1.11 per share on revenue of $6.18 billion. Analysts expected the fintech company to earn $1.07 per share on revenue of $6.23 billion. Some of the financial highlights were net revenue of $6.18 billion, growing 13% on a spot and FX-neutral basis, GAAP EPS of $0.92 compared to $0.86 in Q3 2020, operating cash flow of $1.51 billion, growing 15%, and free cash flow of $1.29 billion, growing 20%.



The business outlook for the Fiscal Year 2021 was also mixed. Revenue is expected to grow about 18%, and PYPL expects to end the year with more than 430 million active accounts. 



The most important news is that PayPal estimates that for the Fiscal Year 2021, GAAP EPS is expected to be about $3.62 compared to $3.54 in FY 2020. If this is the actual figure, then there will be an increase of only 2.3% for 2021, a significant decline compared to the diluted EPS growth of 71% for 2020.



Bitcoin Concern: Why Wider Adoption Poses Risks



In late 2020, PayPal launched a cryptocurrency trading service and has also allowed online shopping using cryptocurrencies. In August, it announced that you could trade cryptocurrency in the UK on its platform. 



I am not convinced that a switch to broader use of cryptocurrency is positive for PayPal. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and subject to risks such as regulation and taxation on a global basis.



Valuation: A Lofty One 



On a relative valuation analysis, PYPL stock seems to be overvalued. PYPL has a P/E ratio of 51.3x compared to the U.S. IT industry average of 36.8x. The stock is also overvalued based on its price-to-book ratio of 11.5x compared to the U.S. IT industry average of 5x.



Wall Street's Take



PayPal has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 23 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average PayPal price target of $276.52 implies 35% upside potential.

It’s unrealistic to expect stocks to go parabolic, even for industries that have long-term secular tailwinds. There can be near-term dips that serve as a buying opportunity.



The digital payments industry is in a phase of sustained adoption and growth. Just in 2020, consumers spent $900 billion more at online retailers versus the previous two-year period. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this digital payment trend.



In the United States, digital payments penetration is already at 78% for 2020. Emerging markets have significant catching up to do in the coming years.



Overall, the industry trend is likely to remain positive, and PayPal is one of the top stocks to consider.



There are two main reasons that have contributed to the recent sell-off.



First, there have been concerns about the company’s ability to sustain its growth trajectory.



Furthermore, this concern was exaggerated because PayPal announced in October that it’s likely to buy Pinterest (PINS). While PayPal has backed off from the potential acquisition, it does indicate that the company is looking at the inorganic route to accelerate growth.



PayPal is a Cash Flow Machine



A key reason to be bullish on PayPal is the company’s cash flow potential.



For Q3 2021, PayPal reported $1.3 billion in free cash flows. Further, at the end of the quarter, the company had $20 billion in cash and equivalents.



Another note is that PayPal generated $0.21 in free cash flow for every $1 in revenue. The company is targeting revenue of $50 billion by 2025. If the same free cash flow conversion rate is assumed, the company is positioned to deliver at least $10 billion in annual FCF.



It’s also worth noting that for 2021, the company has guided for revenue of $25.3 billion to $25.4 billion. Assuming that it can achieve a revenue target of $50 billion, PayPal is positioned to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% through 2025.



For the current quarter, the company’s revenue growth was 13%. It seems entirely likely that growth will accelerate.



The first reason is the cash buffer and sustained cash inflow. This will allow PayPal to make significant investments and pursue potential acquisitions.



Another reason is the potential in emerging markets. Digital payments are at an inflection point of growth globally. PayPal estimates that the total addressable market is $110 trillion. Therefore, achieving or surpassing the $50 billion target is realistic.



In terms of specific business highlights for Q3 2021, Venmo has teamed up with Amazon (AMZN) to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout. This is a growth trigger for Venmo for 2022 and beyond.



Cryptocurrency Driven Growth



Recently, Mastercard (MA) announced that it's partnering with leading digital cryptocurrencies companies across Asia-Pacific.



The objective is to launch the region's first crypto-linked payments card. As the adoption of cryptocurrency increases at a robust pace, more companies are likely to introduce crypto payment options in the coming years.



PayPal has already enabled buying, selling, and holding for some major cryptocurrencies.



I would not be surprised if digital payment is enabled in crypto in the coming years. This will serve as another growth catalyst. PayPal is already expanding cryptocurrency support to new regions.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, PayPal has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 22 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average PayPal price target of $279.08 implies 31.7% upside potential.







Bottom Line



PayPal has ambitious targets, and the company has the financial flexibility to pursue aggressive growth. There is ample scope for digital payment penetration in developing economies. PayPal is well-positioned to benefit.



From an investor perspective, the correction presents a buying opportunity. Considering its free cash flow potential, PayPal stock is likely to be a long-term value creator.

When it comes to the financial technology market, an IndustryARC report anticipates it to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026.



Let's compare two digital payments companies, Paysafe (PSFE) and PayPal (PYPL) using the TipRanks stock comparison tool and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Paysafe



Investors seemed disappointed with Paysafe’s Q3 results. The specialized payments platform saw “softer than expected” revenues fall 1% year-over-year to $353.6 million, while net loss widened from $38.1 million to $147.2 million in Q3.  



Philip McHugh, CEO of Paysafe, commented that the decline in revenues was a result of “both market and performance challenges within the digital wallet business.”



The company operates across three business segments including its Digital Wallet segment, eCash Solutions, and Integrated Processing segment.



The digital wallet segment saw revenues decline 15% year-over-year to $83.7 million in Q3. This segment includes brands like NETELLER and Skrill. The company underlined some of the headwinds for the Digital Wallet segment at its Q3 earnings call including softer European sports betting activity, and regulatory headwinds in Germany and the Netherlands. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



The weak Q3 results have led to the company lowering its guidance for FY21, and it now expects revenues between $1.47 billion and $1.48 billion from its prior outlook in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to be between $425 million and $435 million.



Evercore ISI analyst David Togut expects that “2022 will be a transition year with 2023 demonstrating the first potential proof points of improvement in the digital wallet business” for PSFE.



As a result, Togut has cut his FY22 “revenue and adjusted EBITDA [estimate] by $203 million and $146 million, to $1.531 billion and $439 million, respectively.” Moreover, Togut expects that the company will face “structural headwinds from regulatory changes in digital wallets fueling a mid to high teens revenue decline partially offset by inorganic contribution in eCash and double-digit growth in Integrated Processing.”



Considering these challenges, Togut has lowered the stock from a Buy to a Neutral and has drastically cut the price target from $15 to $4 (9.2% downside) on the stock.



Wall Street analysts, however, are cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy rating based on four Buys, and four Holds. The average Paysafe price target of $8.31 implies approximately 88.7% upside potential to current levels.







PayPal



PayPal’s notable payment solutions include PayPal, PayPal Credit, and Venmo.



Third-quarter revenues soared 13% year-over-year to $6.18 billion but below the consensus estimate of $6.23 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.11 per share surpassing consensus estimates of $1.07.



Dan Schulman, PayPal president and CEO, commented on the earnings call that while revenues did show an uptick, they were “slightly below our expectations as back-to-school sales and travel were weaker than we expected.”



More importantly, the company’s total payment volume (TPV) increased 26% year-over-year on a spot currency basis to $310 billion, even as eBay’s (EBAY) TPV fell 45% during Q3 and made up 3% of PYPL’s overall TPV from 7% in the same period a year back.



PayPal had a significant presence on online marketplaces like eBay. PayPal was spun-off by eBay in 2015, but until last year, purchases on eBay were still being processed through PayPal. This deal is expected to end this year, following the development of eBay’s own payment platform, Managed Payments



The big news at PYPL’s Q3 earnings was its partnership with Amazon (AMZN), that will enable Amazon’s customers in the United States to pay with Venmo at checkout.



Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian expects that this tie-up with Amazon will create a “significant volume opportunity” for Amazon. The analyst explained that “the addition of Amazon meaningful expands the ecommerce TAM [total addressable market] for Venmo and should also have a 'halo effect' by bringing more attention to Pay with Venmo, driving incremental merchant acceptance and consumer usage.”



While the analyst acknowledged that PYPL’s near-term outlook was “overshadowed by volume headwinds and margin pressures” he still sees “PayPal as uniquely positioned within e-commerce as a solid 20% top-line grower with comparatively strong margins.”



The analyst reiterated his bullish stance on the stock following the Q3 results with a Buy rating but lowered its price target from $325 to $290 (35.7% upside) on the stock.



Wall Street analysts echo Sebastian’s view and are also bullish about the stock, with a Strong Buy rating based on 22 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell. The average PayPal price target of $279.08 implies approximately 30.3% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



While analysts seem to be wait-and-see mode with Paysafe considering the slowdown in the digital wallets business, they are more bullish about PayPal.

4205,"Electronic payments company PayPal’s (PYPL) shares tanked 10.5% at close Tuesday after a dismal Q3 print. 



The top line missed Street estimates and so did management’s Q4 guidance. The company did outpace Street estimates for adjusted earnings per share, but the beat can be attributed only to a lower tax rate. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



What Led to Price Drop



Management expects the transition of eBay to its own managed payments system upon the expiration of the agreement with PayPal to be a near-term headwind looming in Q4. 



Moreover, supply chain disruptions and soft spending in the travel/back-to-school space are expected to weigh on payment volumes in Q4.



Management released preliminary guidance for the full year of 2022, which indicates around 18% year-over-year growth in revenues, which is also below Street’s expectations. These points led many investors to shake off PayPal from their portfolio.



Website Traffic Shows Downward Trend



Another interesting piece of data that we came across with the help of TipRanks’s website traffic tool is a sharp drop in visits to PayPal’s website in the current quarter. 



We saw that total visits from unique users to the company’s website from all devices sharply declined sequentially by 64.3%, after remaining fairly flat through the first half of the year.



It is interesting to note here that PayPal’s website had experienced a 239.6% spike in website visits from unique users during the Q4 of 2020. Also, the stock price during this period had climbed by 18.9%.



It is possible that last year’s spike was due to increased payments activity as the world was recovering from the pandemic this time last year, and economies were reopening with fresh hope. However, PayPal’s loss of website visitors seems to reflect the headwinds like sluggish travel scene and loss of a big client (eBay). 







However, when we looked at this year’s quarter-to-date period and compared it with the corresponding quarter-to-date period of last year, we saw a 10.2% increase in unique visitors to the website.



Again, comparing this year’s to-date period to the same period last year, we noticed that the visits to the company’s website jumped 18.1%.



Analyst Expresses Concerns



Immediately after the earnings call, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. He, however, did not set a price target. “While we view Paypal as a long-term winner in digital payments, the near-term outlook is lukewarm as eBay volumes remain a headwind and travel/back-to-school spending is coming in weak,” he opined.



Tandon also notes that PayPal’s new partnership with Amazon (AMZN) for its peer-to-peer payment service Venmo also doesn’t seem too likely to reflect positively on near-term revenues. For context, PayPal inked a partnership with Amazon in which purchases on the Amazon app can be made via Venmo.



Wall Street Stays Positive



On the other hand, Wall Street analyst consensus is optimistic about PayPal, with a Strong Buy rating based on 23 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. The average PayPal price target of $286.48 indicates an upside potential of 38.8%.

4347,"Paypal Holdings (PYPL), a pioneer in the payments infrastructure market, will release third-quarter 2021 earnings on November 8.



Paypal's stock has risen about 27% over the past year and is now trading at around $229. Expanding government efforts around the world to automate payments, greater internet penetration, and a growing rate of payments made on smartphones, all appear to be helping the company thrive.



The stock price might rise even more as a result of strong Q3 results.



We have utilized TipRanks’ Website Traffic tool to try to obtain a sense of the company's status ahead of the 3Q21 print. The tool aids in determining how a company's internet traffic is trending.



See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks >>



Paypal’s Website Traffic is on the Rise



We saw an increase in visits to Paypal's website between July and September.



In the third quarter, 676.8 million unique visitors were registered across all devices, up 14.04% year-over-year and 1.98% sequentially.



Furthermore, when comparing the number of unique website visits from January 2021 to September 2021 to the same period last year, a 19.10% rise was seen.



This does provide some insight into the company's third-quarter performance. Higher website visits, although not always translating into more business, do indicate that more consumers or potential customers have visited the site to research its offerings and plans, and so on.







Examining User Location by Region



In order to acquire further insights from the website traffic statistics, we may analyze the data by region.



In September, the United States accounted for 48.5% of all overall user traffic. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom accounted for 11.8% of all visits, putting the country in the second position, ahead of Germany (10.5%). Countries such as Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, and Canada, on the other hand, each contributed to less than 5% of total user traffic.







Expectations for Q3



PayPal has been making significant investments in upgrading its end-user products. Further, its efforts in cryptocurrencies and the mobile banking space should provide it with significant growth potential in the upcoming quarter.



For the third quarter of 2021, PayPal estimates sales between $6.15 billion and $6.25 billion, reflecting an increase of 13-14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings are predicted to be $1.07 per share, more or less in line with the year-ago period.



For the upcoming quarter, investors should look to see if a resurgence in leisure spending, such as travel and other activities, has lifted PayPal's volume. Furthermore, the holiday season's spending may act as a catalyst for this payment service.



Wall Street’s Take



According to TipRanks’ consensus rating, Paypal stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 14 unanimous Buys. As for price targets, the average PYPL price target of $337.67 implies 47.2% upside potential from the current levels.
