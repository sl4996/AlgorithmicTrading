1792,"The current investment scenario is exploding with a multitude of choices amidst the ongoing hot earnings season. With the worst of the pandemic behind us, companies are exuberating with positivity about all things good in the forthcoming quarters. Most of us with limited knowledge and acumen in market timing find it difficult to make investment choices. At such times, it is best to follow an expert’s advice in the given field. Today in our “Expert Spotlight,” we will look at one of the best expert bloggers of recent times, The Value Portfolio. The Value Portfolio is a five-star financial blogger from Seeking Alpha and conducts in-depth research on several companies with expertise in the energy sector. Additionally, the blogger covers sectors including healthcare and technology, and also focuses on articles that help in building a retirement portfolio. How Does the Expert Blogger Fare on TipRanks List? According to the TipRanks Star Ranking System, The Value Portfolio wins the second spot out of the 10,026 bloggers tracked in the TipRanks universe. Notably, the five-star blogger bagged the number three spot out of the total 17,911 experts tracked by TipRanks, including hedge fund managers, Wall Street analysts, corporate insiders, financial bloggers, and individual investors. Expert Blogger’s Performance Turning to the performance measures, The Value Portfolio boasts a success rate of 73% with an average return per rating of 32.9%. Moreover, compared to the S&P 500 (SPX), the blogger has generated a success rate of 59%, with an average return of 13.1%. Compared to the benchmark sector, the blogger has earned a success rate of 62% with an average return of 16.7%. Notably, out of the 820 total ratings given by the blogger to date, 97.6% have carried a Bullish rating, 2.2% have owned a Bearish rating, and the remaining negligible ratings have been Neutral. To date, the Value Portfolio’s best rating was a Buy call on DCP Midstream Partners (DCP), which engages in various activities related to natural gas. Between March 30, 2020, and March 30, 2021, the expert blogger’s Buy call generated an astronomical 615.8% return on the DCP stock. With this background in mind, let us look at The Value Portfolio’s latest blogs on two stocks. Altria Group (MO) Based out of Virginia, the Altria Group is primarily a tobacco company and manufactures and sells cigarettes, smokeless products, and wine in the United States. The Value Portfolio is highly optimistic about the MO stock and has given out consistent Bullish recommendations on the stock. The blogger has earned an 85% success rate on MO stock, with an average profit on the stock of 23%. Even other bloggers in the TipRanks universe have an 86% bullish sentiment on the MO stock, much higher compared to the sector average of 68%. In its first-quarter results reported recently, Altria Group beat both earnings and revenue estimates, and also guided for full-year fiscal 2022 earnings ahead of consensus. The outstanding performance was recognized by a series of upward revisions in target prices by several Wall Street analysts. Following the results, The Value Portfolio gave the following insight into the company’s performance, “Altria is suffering from inflation, hurting the tobacco business after several years of a decline slowdown. The company has seen its earnings and ability to drive shareholder rewards grow consistently. Additionally, the company is expanding volumes of non-cigarette tobacco and other sin products. We expect this combination will enable Altria to provide increasing and growing shareholder rewards.” Exxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil is one of America’s largest oil and gas producers and engages in the exploration, development, and distribution of oil, gas, and petroleum products. Being an expert in the energy sector, The Value Portfolio has a highly Bullish outlook on the XOM stock. The blogger has earned an 83% success rate on his XOM blogs, with an attractive average profit on the stock of 33.8%. Echoing the same sentiment as our expert blogger, even the other bloggers in the TipRanks universe have a 93% bullish sentiment on the XOM stock, much higher compared to the sector average of 76%. Despite the increased fuel prices, Exxon reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter results. However, the company tripled its share buyback program to $30 billion (from $10 billion) through 2023, based on its 218.5% year-over-year jump in earnings. Exxon’s results too were also followed by a couple of upward price target revisions by analysts. Responding to XOM’s results, The Value Portfolio gave the following insights into the stock’s future potential, “The company had incredibly strong earnings despite the impact of exiting Russia, with a strong continued commitment to shareholder returns. XOM is paying down debt, and its low-carbon business will continue to provide it with long-term earnings. A cheaper oil industry, combined with physical assets, means a unique ability to continue performing in a high inflation environment.” Concluding Thoughts To make impactful investment choices, it’s prudent to follow the judgment of experts who are constantly in the know. Active and expert bloggers like The Value Portfolio’s insights into companies can provide a much-needed boost to our investment returns.

2207,"Last week marked the second consecutive weekly decline in oil prices, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, closing 1% weaker at $98.26 a barrel on April 8. Oil prices fell on a weekly basis as the member countries of the International Energy Agency, including the U.S., announced their plans to release more reserves to bring down global prices. The recovery in energy demand following the reopening of economies and the Ukraine-Russia crisis triggered a sharp rise in oil and gas prices, benefiting stocks in the energy sector. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP), which includes major oil and gas companies, has rallied 46% year-to-date. We used the TipRanks stock comparison tool for energy stocks to compare Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips to see if Wall Street analysts see further upside potential in these stocks following a strong run.   Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) Exxon Mobil is one of the largest integrated energy companies and is involved in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and natural gas. It markets fuels, lubricants, and chemicals under four brands –Esso, Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil. A rebound in oil and gas prices fueled by the recovery in energy demand drove a 57.3% rise in the company’s 2021 revenue to $285.6 billion. Adjusted EPS came in at $5.38 in 2021, compared to a loss per share of $0.33 in 2020. The company cut its capital spending to $16.6 billion in 2021 from $21.4 billion in 2020. The energy giant generated operating cash flows of $48 billion in 2021, which according to the company, is the highest level since 2012 and reflects a significant rise compared to $14.7 billion in 2020. Further, Exxon reduced its debt by $20 billion in 2021, bringing debt back to pre-pandemic levels. Exxon’s initiatives to streamline its business and cut down its costs helped deliver savings of $1.9 billion in 2021. It is now on track to exceed its target of reducing costs by $6 billion by 2023. Given its improved financial position, Exxon initiated share repurchases in Q122 as part of its $10 billion buyback program over the next 12 to 24 months. Also, Exxon retained its status as a dividend aristocrat (a term used for companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years) by increasing its quarterly dividend to $0.88 from $0.87. This marked the 39th consecutive annual dividend hike. Exxon’s forward dividend yield stands at 4.1%. Following Exxon’s recent favorable update about Q122, Bank of America Securities analyst Doug Leggate raised his estimate for Q122 EPS from $2.15 to $2.18. The analyst noted that the upward revision in guidance was “driven mainly by strong upstream earnings more than offsetting slightly lower contributions from Chemicals and Corporate QoQ with downstream relatively in-line.” Leggate added, “XOM has hit its debt targets, is ready to accelerate buy backs in our view and is the only major to emerge from COVID with line of sight to expand FcF [Free Cash Flow].” Leggate maintained a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil stock, with a price target of $120. Meanwhile, the Street is cautiously optimistic about Exxon Mobil based on 10 Buys and 13 Holds. At $89.59, the average Exxon Mobil price target implies a modest 3.17% upside potential from current levels. The stock has rallied about 42% year-to-date.   Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) Integrated energy company Chevron delivered mixed Q421 results earlier this year, with revenue beating analysts’ estimates and earnings lagging the Street’s expectations. Q421 earnings were impacted by weaker-than-estimated production. Chevron’s revenue increased 72% to $162.5 billion in 2021, and adjusted EPS surged to $8.13 from $0.09 in 2020, a year severely impacted by a pandemic-induced slump in demand.   Higher crude oil and natural gas prices helped boost Chevron’s operating cash flows to $29.2 billion in 2021 from $10.6 billion in 2020. This helped the company reduce debt by $12.9 billion. Chevron's capital and exploratory expenditures came in at $11.7 billion in 2021, compared to $13.5 billion in 2020. Chevron anticipates capital spending in the $15 billion to $17 billion range for the next five years.   The company aims to grow its renewable fuels production capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by 2030 and is acquiring Renewable Energy Group in a $3.15 billion cash deal to accelerate this goal. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022. Chevron is also a dividend aristocrat and has increased its dividends for 35 consecutive years, including a 6% hike in its quarterly dividend per share this year to $1.42. Chevron’s forward dividend yield is 3.3%. Recently, UBS analyst Luiz Carvalho raised his price target on Chevron stock to $192 from $150 and reaffirmed a Buy rating, citing the company's lower exposure to Russia than its peers along with his updated crude oil price deck forecasts. However, RBC Capital analyst Biraj Borkhataria told investors, “CVX has outperformed the rest of the integrateds by some margin and we believe shares may take a pause in the near term as analysts calibrate company specific issues for 1Q. Notably, our Chevron earnings estimate is the only one where we're below consensus across the group.” Borkhataria has a Buy rating on Chevron and a price target of $160. To summarize, the Street is cautiously optimistic about Chevron, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys and eight Holds. Following a 44.8% rally in the stock so far this year, the average Chevron price target of $164.63 implies a downside potential of 3.12% from current levels. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) ConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading exploration and production companies, with operations in 14 countries. It became an upstream pure-play following the spin-off of its downstream business in 2012 to create the independent company Phillips 66 (PSX). ConocoPhillips is known for its low-cost structure and efficiency. In its 4Q21 conference call, the company indicated that its free cash flow break-even point is around $30 per barrel. Meanwhile, higher realized prices and volumes helped ConocoPhillips generate revenue of $48.3 billion in 2021, up 151% from 2020. The company posted adjusted EPS of $6.01 in 2021 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $0.97 in 2020. Improved business conditions helped ConocoPhillips generate operating cash flows of $17 billion in 2021, up from $4.8 billion in 2020. The company continues to dispose of non-core assets as part of its ongoing efforts to focus on “low cost of supply opportunities.” Last month, ConocoPhillips completed the sale of its Indonesia assets to MedcoEnergi for about $1.36 billion. ConocoPhillips expects capital spending of $7.2 billion in 2022, up from $5.3 billion in 2021. Capital expenditure this year includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, and investments in early-stage low-carbon opportunities.    Further, the company expects to return $8 billion to shareholders in 2022, reflecting a 30% increase over 2021. These payments include an ordinary dividend per share of $0.46 and a second-quarter variable return of cash (VROC) payment of $0.30. On March 31, Mizuho analyst Vincent Lovaglio increased his long-term oil price forecast to $70 per barrel from $61, with his 2022-25 estimates up $16 per barrel on average, driven by an increase in estimated U.S. unconventional oil volume growth and the resulting increase in capital intensity. Given the increase in the price deck, Lovaglio raised his price targets for exploration and production companies, including ConocoPhillips stock to $150 from $115. Lovaglio reiterated a Buy rating on ConocoPhillips. On TipRanks, ConocoPhillips scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and three Holds. The average ConocoPhillips price target of $116.50 suggests 13.05% upside potential from current levels. The stock has advanced about 43% year-to-date.   Conclusion Shares of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have had an impressive run so far this year and have outperformed the broader market. However, Wall Street analysts are more bullish on ConocoPhillips and see higher upside potential from current levels. Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.

The next 12-18 months will be pivotal for Moody's assessment of the extent to which LNG production levels and government's management of future revenues will lead to sustainable improvements in the sovereign's economic and fiscal strength.The affirmation of the Caa2 rating is underpinned by persistent credit weaknesses suggesting a still-high risk of default.",2022-03-11

4262,Exxon Mobil sees higher gas prices boosting earnings by $700 million to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.,2021-12-31
4263,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) expects to post an annual profit in 2021 on the back of operating gains of up to $1.9 billion, per the company’s regulatory filing. 



Notably, the expected gain exceeds the one-time charges driven by strong oil and gas prices.



Expectations 



Per the filing, the largest U.S. oil producer expects sequentially higher profit from oil and gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, refining and chemicals operating profits are likely to be flat to lower on a sequential basis. 



The regulatory filing indicated that one-time charges associated with asset impairments and contractual costs are anticipated to reduce oil and gas earnings by up to $1.2 billion. No details regarding the production assets were provided. 



According to ExxonMobil, expected lower margins in chemicals might decrease profits by $600 million to $800 million, compared to $2.14 billion recorded in the prior quarter. Additionally, Refining margins are anticipated to be flat or drop by $200 million on a sequential basis. 



On a positive note, ExxonMobil indicated mark-to-market gains of up to $1.1 billion for oil and gas and refined products. Proceeds from asset sales, including the company’s U.K. North Sea assets are likely to be $500 million. 



Based on current expectations, the company plans to spend $20 billion to $25 billion per year on new projects through 2027, including $2.5 billion per year on carbon reductions. Markedly, the company expects to double its pre-pandemic annual profit by 2025. 



Wall Street’s Take 



On December 15, RBC Capital analyst Biraj Borkhataria maintained a Sell rating and a price target of $70 (14.5% upside potential) on the stock. 



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, six Holds, and three Sells. The average ExxonMobil price target of $72.33 implies 18.3% upside potential from current levels.



ExxonMobil’s upcoming earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2021 is likely to be released on February 1, 2022.  



Smart Score 



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score system, ExxonMobil gets a 6 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

4387,"Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) engages in the exploration, development, and distribution of oil, gas, and petroleum products. It operates through the following segments: Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. The Upstream segment produces crude oil and natural gas, Downstream manufactures and trades petroleum products, and the Chemical segment offers petrochemicals.



Compared to other oil stocks, shares of Exxon Mobil have performed very well in 2021, with a yearly gain of over 50% (including dividends). 







Dividend stocks such as XOM stock offer income generation and increase total returns, especially in times of significant price appreciation, which has occurred for this oil giant in 2021. 



I am neutral on XOM stock. I see a lot of value in the turnaround within the first nine months of the soon-to-end year 2021, but critical risks are hard to ignore.



Exxon Mobil: The Good News



The Q3 2021 earnings report was strong. All three of Exxon’s core businesses generated positive earnings, supporting the financial recovery in 2021 compared to a bad Fiscal Year 2020 due to the pandemic crisis. 



In Q3 2021, Exxon generated revenue of S73.8 billion, up 9.6% quarter-over-quarter, net income of $6.75 billion, up 43.9% quarter-over-quarter, and EPS (diluted) of $1.58, up 43.9% compared to $1.1 in Q2 2021. This is a significant improvement from the EPS of -$0.16 in Q3 2020.



The firm announced that in the fourth quarter, the dividend would increase to $0.88 per share, up 1.1% compared to the previous quarterly dividend of $0.87. Starting in 2022, there will be a share repurchase program of up to $10 billion over 12-24 months.



Free cash flow reported of $9.25 billion was sufficient to cover the dividend payment of $3.72 billion.



Exxon Mobil will apply a corporate plan of maintaining disciplined capital investments constant at $20-$25 billion per year and is already on track to achieve 2025 emission-reduction plans by this year-end. 



Within the next years up to 2027, there are plans to pursue investments in high-return advantaged projects and focus on greenhouse gas emission reductions to address climate change.



The turnaround achieved in the first nine months of 2021 for Exxon Mobil is remarkable. Net earnings of $14.17 billion have been achieved, compared to -$2.37 billion for the first nine months of 2020. 



After a $22.44 billion net loss in 2020, Exxon is set to return to profitability in 2021. Debt reduction is a positive factor that is strengthening the balance sheet.



Not all key metrics are supportive, though now. I am concerned about three risks.



Exxon Mobil: Three Risks to Monitor



While the current debt-to-equity ratio may not seem excessive, XOM's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08 is too low and poses severe liquidity issues.



Next, Exxon Mobil has a 10-year revenue CAGR of -6.2%, which is obviously not ideal.



Finally, Exxon Mobil has a weak trend in terms of efficiency as inventory turnover, fixed assets turnover, and asset turnover had all declined in 2019 before the pandemic. I would like to see the efficiency gain momentum when 2021 is completed.



The Omicron variant and uncertain oil prices have diverged opinions between OPEC and the IEA (International Energy Agency).



OPEC remains confident that oil demand will continue to be strong and recover from the pandemic lows, as at one time crude oil futures turned negative. On the other hand, the IEA believes Omicron will harm global oil demand. In the EU, the Netherlands announced a lockdown to fight the pandemic. Other countries may follow. That would be bad news for oil prices and Exxon Mobil.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Exxon Mobil has a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, six Holds, and three Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Exxon Mobil price target of $72.33 represents a 23.5% upside potential.

4483,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) stock has performed strongly over the past 12 months, following the oil and gas price increase.



The Irving, Texas-based global crude oil and natural gas giant saw its shares rise about 46%.



Exxon Mobil combines exploration and production activities, currently operating over 22,200 wells across the United States and internationally. In the most recent quarter ended September 30, production yielded 3.7 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, which, net of one-offs, increased 2% year-over-year.



As I expect higher fossil fuel prices year-on-year in 2022, Exxon Mobil's stock should grow with it. Thus, I am bullish on this stock. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks).



Q3 Earnings Results



Thanks to higher oil and gas prices coupled with an increase in motor fuel demand, Exxon Mobil beat analyst expectations on earnings and total revenues for the third quarter of 2021.



The oil and gas giant posted pro-forma earnings of $1.57 per share (a turnaround from the year-ago net loss of $0.15) on total revenues of $73.8 billion (up nearly 60% year-over-year), topping projections in both cases, as analysts expected $1.56 EPS on revenue of $71.1 billion. 



The profit of $6.92 billion was a four-year record regarding a three-month reporting period. The Upstream and Downstream results were positive again, while the Chemical segment's profit improved significantly.



Operating cash flow increased about 170% year over year to $12.1 billion, allowing the company to further strengthen the balance sheet by significantly reducing its debt exposure.



Energy Price Outlook



To reduce energy costs (largely responsible for October's record inflation), the U.S. and other non-OPEC members are coordinating an action to release strategic barrels of oil. 



This has already produced considerable results in terms of a lower price per barrel (down over 15% from highs) and an improved U.S. trade deficit, down more than $14 billion from the September record high gap of $81.4 billion.



However, the effects shouldn't last much longer than this winter as non-strategic stock available around the world can cover the energy demand for a couple of months at the most. On the other hand, OPEC + will not ship more barrels than those it is currently supplying, which will be exerting upward pressure on the price of oil.



The current price downturn, which has barely affected Exxon Mobil stock, is likely to ease in February-March 2022 and then rebound strongly.



At that point, when the third mass vaccination campaign is in full swing and concerns about variants are expected to subside, many of the COVID-19 restrictions, especially those on air flights, will be lifted.



This will unleash the pent-up demand for fossil fuels, which could push the price per barrel up very fast, and potentially the share price of many operators as well, including Exxon Mobil.



The gradual improvement of the global situation will also be the primary driver for a higher gas price next year.



Future Portfolio Developments



Starting 2022, the company will allocate no less than $20 billion to mineral activities and green projects every year until 2027. 



Specifically, the company will keep on developing its oil discoveries in Guyana. It will also focus on offshores in Brazil and the Permian basin and work on a major gas project in Vietnam. 



In addition, Exxon received new oil and gas exploration rights from Cyprus to exercise in the Mediterranean. The resumption of talks between Athens and Ankara after several years of tensions coupled with the crisis in the Turkish lira could soften the Turkish government's stance on maritime claims.



In China, Exxon plans to build a high-performance polymers production complex, chasing growing domestic Chinese demand.



The company aims to achieve its net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target through green projects in the Permian Basin, the American Gulf of Mexico, and The Netherlands.



Looking Ahead to 2022 and Beyond



As the following clues suggest, the business should gradually get better:



The company aims to continue to return cash to its shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends share buybacks under a $10 billion program beginning next year. Management points to doubling earnings by 2025. 



Wall Street's Take



In the past three months, 13 Wall Street analysts have issued a 12-month price target for XOM. The company has a Hold consensus rating, based on six Buys, six Holds, and three Sell ratings.



The average Exxon Mobil Corporation price target is $71.80, implying 14.8% upside potential.







Summary



I think this stock will continue to perform well in the coming months, driven by an expected increase in oil and gas prices.

4540,"Accelerating its target of emission-reduction for unconventional operations in New Mexico and Texas, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the U.S. Permian Basin. Following the announcement, shares of the global oil and gas corporation closed 1.2% higher on Monday.



Exxon Mobil aims to reduce Upstream greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 40-50% by 2030, compared to 2016 levels. (See ExxonMobil stock charts on TipRanks)



Plan Details 



The electrification of operations, increased methane mitigation and detection technology investments, the elimination of routine flaring, and equipment and technology upgrades to include nature-based solutions, are expected to be supportive factors for the company's greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts in the Permian Basin.



By the end of 2021, flaring volumes across the company’s Permian Basin operations are expected to be reduced by more than 75% compared to 2019. Additionally, the company hopes to eliminate all routine flaring in the Permian by the end of 2022. 



Achievements & Expectations 



The company is likely to exceed its 2025 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, which were announced in December 2020. Markedly, at the end of 2021, a reduction of 15-20% in greenhouse gas intensity from Upstream operations compared to 2016 levels is anticipated, four years ahead of  schedule. Additionally, a reduction of 40-50% in methane intensity and 35-45% in flaring intensity is also expected. 



As of September 30, 2021, ExxonMobil recorded an average production of 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from its unconventional assets in the Permian Basin. This constituted more than 40% of the company’s U.S. net production. ExxonMobil expects greenhouse gas emissions to decline with increased production in the Permian. 



CEO Comments 



The CEO of ExxonMobil, Darren Woods, said, “Our groundbreaking plans to reach net-zero for Permian Basin operations further demonstrate our commitment and support of society’s ambitions for a lower-emissions future. We have plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity across our businesses by deploying the capabilities and technical strengths that are foundational to ExxonMobil.”

4576,"Are you ready to be intrigued? Then take a look at energy firm ExxonMobil (XOM), which recently detailed its upcoming plans for capital expenditure (CapEx) spending. 



The company is planning to shell out some serious money in the next few years, but that's not all it's got on tap. ExxonMobil also made some bold claims about the kinds of return it's expecting on that spending, and the news is pretty big. 



I'm mildly bullish on ExxonMobil because it's selling a product that many markets need. I'm only mildly bullish, however, because of the sheer number of competitors in that space. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Looking at ExxonMobil's stock chart for the year so far shows a company mainly making gains. The company's stock price was up over 50% from the start of this year. It's also trading close to its highs for the year currently.



January saw the company kick things off with a huge spike that lasted well into March. That spike also made $60 a share look credible. A subsequent slump lead to a plateau in the $52-$54 range for the second half of March and most of April. 



April's end saw the stock begin to climb again. Climb it did, until early July, when another leg down kicked in and lasted until late September. That was when the company started the spike that put it at new highs for 2021. It's started another leg down since, but has held close to $60. (See ExxonMobil stock charts on TipRanks)



ExxonMobil announced that it was establishing annual CapEx spending for the year and used pretty big numbers to do so, too. The company set its spending between $20 billion and $25 billion for the next several years, going through 2027. 



That's actually a step up from earlier projections that called for ExxonMobil to drop between $16 billion and $19 billion on CapEx in 2021. Earlier projections of $20 billion to $25 billion ended in 2025 rather than 2027. Reports note the company plans to put particular focus on ""low-carbon businesses.""



What will ExxonMobil get for that big spend? The company made bold claims on that front as well. It asserted that it would be able to double its earnings over the next six years. 



The new focus on low-carbon spending seems to be coming from three new members of ExxonMobil's board of directors, who joined in earlier this year following a proxy battle with shareholders. 



ExxonMobil is looking to make substantial gains from projects in the Permian shale patch and South America. It also looks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated for oil and gas production as high as 50% by 2030.



Still Keeping the World Running...for Now



The good news is that ExxonMobil's short-term prospects are pretty good. Say what you will, but the world runs on gasoline, and that's essentially ExxonMobil's big stock in trade. 



Working in petroleum extraction is something of a growth market these days. Have you seen the cost of a gallon of gas lately? While several other firms are involved in that market, generally, there's enough business to go around. 



After all, ExxonMobil plans to drop between $140 billion and $175 billion just on capital expenditures from 2021-27. That requires you to have that kind of money to begin with.



However, the bad news is that the long-term picture for ExxonMobil is a little less bright. The growth of the electric vehicle market is likely to take a lot of punch out of the petroleum market. Each is a replacement suitable for the other, so when someone buys an electric car, their demand for petroleum plummets accordingly. Every electric vehicle sale is that much less gas sold. That could easily mean less gas sold in another 10 to 20 years.



Making projections that far out gets difficult, however. No one can tell with much certainty what tomorrow's conditions will be like. Trying to predict 10 years away involves so many variables that most success is almost pure blind luck. 



However, there are certainly a lot of factors massing against ExxonMobil, which limits its overall value as an investment for the next few years. Electric vehicles are undercutting it on several fronts. New advances in plastics—like the latest that calls for salmon sperm—are undercutting that market as well.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, ExxonMobil has a Hold consensus rating. That's based on six Buys, six Holds, and three Sells assigned in the past three months. The average ExxonMobil price target of $70.47 implies 15% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $50 per share to a high of $95 per share.







Concluding Views



ExxonMobil provides a product that is, right now, indispensable. People need gas to get to work and do everything they'd normally do. The supply chain depends on trucks that require gas to work. The petroleum derivatives market is also brisk. That makes ExxonMobil one valuable part of a lot of lives.



The key phrase there is ""right now."" That's also why I'm only mildly bullish. Today it's a good investment. Sure, it's trading near the top of its range, and a downturn is comparatively likely. Still, as long as it's selling a key product in keeping the entire world running, it's worth looking into. 



However, it may not have that same cachet by the time its latest CapEx plan runs out. It may not be enough when its primary stock in trade is strictly high-carbon.

Capital Expenditure Plans



ExxonMobil intends to make disciplined capital investments to be between $20 billion and $25 billion per year through 2027. The company stated that the planned capital expenditure will have the flexibility to adjust to adverse market conditions, or any other policy changes for low-emissions projects.



The company’s strategy will continue to target structural cost savings, investment in low-cost-of-supply, lower-emission products, and further portfolio high-grading.



Emission-Reduction Plans



ExxonMobil revealed that it is on track to meet its 2025 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, four years ahead of schedule by year-end 2021. This is driven by accelerated investments in high-return advantaged projects, from existing operations as well as the Low Carbon Solutions business.



Furthermore, ExxonMobil has laid out more aggressive plans for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emission-reduction through 2030, consistent with Paris Agreement pathways.



Similarly, the company reiterated its plans to achieve the goals of the World Bank for zero routine flaring by 2030.



Management Weighs In



ExxonMobil CEO, Darren Woods, commented, “The restored strength of our balance sheet and improved financial outlook support accelerating investment in our industry-advantaged, high-return projects, and a growing list of financially accretive lower-emission business opportunities.”



He further added, “Our strategy is designed to create shareholder value by leveraging our competitive advantages while maintaining flexibility to respond to future policy changes and technology advances associated with the energy transition.”



Wall Street’s Take



Following the news, Jefferies analyst Giacomo Romeo reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with the price target of $59 (1.3% downside potential)



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Exxon Mobil price target of $70.23 implies 17.46% upside potential to current levels.

I am neutral on Exxon Mobil because its strong position in its industry and global economy and attractive valuation multiples are offset by industry headwinds and Wall Street’s neutral stance on the stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Strengths



Not only is ExxonMobil one of the world’s largest companies in terms of revenue, but it is also one of the largest among the world’s Big Oil companies. The company boasts a total of 37 oil refineries in 21 different countries and a total daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels.



ExxonMobil is the largest privately-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 2% of the world’s total energy. It is organized into three business segments: Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical.



Recent Results



ExxonMobil reported earnings of $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, showing an improvement from the previous year, where there was a reported loss of $680 million. Total earnings per common share were $1.57, also showing improvement from the previous year.



Cash flows from operating activities were at $12.1 billion, which were used for capital investments, debt reduction, and dividend payments.



Regarding Upstream, average realizations for crude oil increased 7% from the second quarter, and natural gas increased 28% from the previous quarter. Total earnings for 2021 were $3.9 billion due to higher prices and volumes and reduced expenses. Of these earnings, $3.1 billion were from outside the U.S., while the rest were domestic.



For Downstream, fuel margins showed improvement from the previous quarter, and overall refining throughput improved 5% from the second quarter. Total earnings for Downstream were reported at $1.25 billion, mainly due to improved margins. About $663 million of the total earnings for Downstream were from the U.S., whereas $592 were from other countries.



The chemical segment showed quarterly earnings of $2.1 billion, with strong industry margins and high demand. $1.1 billion of total earnings were from the U.S., whereas the remaining were from other countries.



Valuation Metrics



Exxon Mobil’s stock looks attractively priced at the moment as its enterprise value-to-EBIT ratio is currently 9.1x compared to its historical average of 15x. Furthermore, its price-to-forward normalized earnings ratio is 10.1x compared to its historical average of 13.7x.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Exxon Mobil has a Hold consensus rating based on five Buys, four Holds, and three Sell ratings in the past three months. The average Exxon Mobil price target of $69.73 implies 9.7% upside potential.







Summary and Conclusion



Exxon Mobil is a clear leader in an industry that has traditionally been – and remains – vital to the global economy. Given the significant volatility and disruption facing the industry in recent years, Exxon Mobil’s status as a safe and reliable blue-chip dividend growth stock has been somewhat tarnished. 



Nevertheless, the company has recovered nicely with energy prices over the past year. It is investing aggressively to remain a viable company for decades to come through the ongoing global economic transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.



The stock looks undervalued based on historical averages, though the growth outlook for the company is also weaker than it has been in a long time. 



Wall Street analysts are neutral on the stock and the consensus price target indicates that the upside potential in the stock is mediocre for the foreseeable future. As a result, investors might want to wait for a pullback in the share price before adding shares.

4784,"Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is seeking buyers for its U.S. shale fields. According to Reuters, XOM plans to offload unproductive assets, raise cash, and pay off its huge debt. Shares of the American oil and natural gas explorers closed at $64.37 on November 15.



Barnett Shale Holdings



The proposed sale includes Exxon’s Barnett Shale holdings properties, which cover 2,700 wells across roughly 182,000 acres in North Texas. The properties are worth $400 million to $500 million. Bids are expected till December 2021, and Exxon expects to close the sale in January 2022.



According to Reuters, the Barnett shale assets gas production has reduced by 50% since 2016, to around 227 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) in the first half of this year.



In August 2021, Exxon had put approximately 5,000 natural gas wells in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas for sale. These included 844 operated and 4,104 non-operated wells. According to Exxon, these assets have reduced market value and declining production capacity.  



Exxon excluded several properties in Asia, Africa, the United States, and Europe from its development plan last year. Instead the company will now  focus on production plans in Guyana, offshore Brazil, and the Permian Basin.



Debt Reduction



Around three years ago, Exxon had set a target to raise $15 billion from asset sales by December 2021. The company has received $557 million from sale proceeds up to June 2021 and has $2.15 billion in pending deals.



In 2020, Exxon posted a huge loss of $22.4 billion, and its total debt increased to $70 billion. In 2021, XOM managed to pay back more than $7 billion worth of debt, reducing the total to around $60.60 billion.

Target Price



The Wall Street community has a Hold consensus rating on XOM stock with 5 Buys, 4 Holds, and 3 Sells. The average Exxon Mobil price target of $69.73 implies 8.33% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 68.7% over the past year.

4977,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) delivered mixed third-quarter results with earnings exceeding and revenue missing expectations. The results reflect XOM’s efficient cost control measures, solid operations, as well as increased realizations, and higher fuel demand. Shares rose as much as 1.6% before closing flat at $64.47 on October 29.



XOM is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies and engages in the exploration, development, and distribution of oil, gas, and petroleum products. With a market cap of $272.94 billion, shares have gained 89.7% over the past year. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share, meaningfully higher than analyst estimates of $1.53 per share. In the prior-year quarter, XOM posted an adjusted loss of $0.18 per share.



Further, Q3 total revenue and other income stood at $73.79 billion, up 59.7% year-over-year, but failed to meet the consensus estimate of $75.35 billion. 



The robust revenue growth was attributed to higher pricing and volume mix. XOM also produced 3.66 billion oil-equivalent barrels per day in Q3, a 4% increase year-over-year excluding special items.



Moreover, in Q3, XOM undertook capital and exploration expenses of $3.85 billion, driven by continued strategic investments in Guyana and Permian Basin as well as in Chemical. The company also paid back debt of $4 billion, thereby improving its total debt-to-capital ratio to 25%.



Commenting on the results, Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO of XOM said, “We expect to increase the level of spend in lower-emission energy solutions by four times over the prior plan, adding projects with strong returns as well as seeding some development investment in large hub projects that require further policy support.”



Woods added, “Retaining flexibility to strike a balance across our different investment opportunities, while maintaining a strong balance sheet, is critical to ensure our business produces accretive, long-term returns and remains resilient under a wide range of future scenarios.”



For full-year fiscal 2021, Exxon expects to undertake capital spending of around $20-$25 billion. The company also expects to increase its share buyback program to up to $10 billion starting in 2022.



In response to Exxon Mobil’s quarterly performance, RBC Capital analyst Biraj Borkhataria maintained a Sell rating on the stock with a price target of $65, implying that shares are almost fully valued at current levels.  



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Exxon Mobil price target of $70.17 implies 8.84% upside potential to current levels.

5092,"Oil and gas major Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, an increase of about 1.1% from the previous dividend of $0.87.



Following the news, shares of the company declined 2.6% on Wednesday. The stock, however, pared its losses slightly to close at $64.39 in the extended trading session.



The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2021.



The company’s annual dividend of $3.52 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 5.5% based on Wednesday’s closing price.



Notably, the company has been raising its quarterly dividend consistently over the past eight years (except for 2020), making it an attractive choice for investors. (See ExxonMobil stock chart on TipRanks)



See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>



Recently, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. The analyst, however, raised the price target from $69 to $79, which implies upside potential of 23.2% from current levels.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells. The average ExxonMobil price target of $70.17 implies upside potential of 9.4% from current levels. 



Exxon Mobil scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Shares have gained about 103.1% over the past year.

According to a report from ExxonMobil, by 2040, global demand for liquid fuels is projected to increase to the equivalent of around 110 million barrels of oil per day, up by about 9 percent from 2018.



Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, let’s compare two energy companies, ExxonMobil, and Chevron Corp., mainly based on the risk factors for the stocks.



I am bullish about Exxon Mobil, considering the company is exploring renewable energy solutions while still keeping its financial leverage and operating costs low. In contrast, I am neutral about Chevron Corp.







ExxonMobil (XOM)



ExxonMobil is involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. The company also manufactures, trades, transports, and sells crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and petroleum products.



The company’s business segments include Upstream, Downstream, and Chemicals. ExxonMobil’s Upstream business includes selectively developing oil and natural gas resources, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains.



Its downstream business is involved with the logistics, trading, and refining of oil, while the Chemicals business manufactures and markets petrochemical products.



In Q2, the company turned profitable, with a profit of $4.7 billion or $1.10 per share, after a loss of $1.1 billion in the same period of last year. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.01 per share. ExxonMobil posted revenues of $67.7 billion, a jump of 107.8% year-over-year, and surpassing consensus estimates of $64.6 billion.



It is important to note that ExxonMobil’s business is basically a commodity business, which means the company is susceptible to changing oil, gas, and petrochemical prices. Last year, the balance of supply and demand was significantly disrupted, as the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to reduced business and consumer activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.



However, going by the Q2 results of XOM, this demand seems to be recovering, as the company benefitted from stronger oil prices.



Indeed, according to the TipRanks Risk Factors tool, ExxonMobil seems to be at a high Macro and Political risk of 25%, compared to the sector average of 11.3%. (See Exxon Mobil stock chart on TipRanks)



Interestingly, while ExxonMobil has listed the shift of many countries to alternative energy as a risk, the company is mitigating this risk by pursuing renewable energy solutions.



This is indicated by the fact that XOM has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to “participate in a major carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Scotland and to explore the development of CO2 [carbon dioxide] infrastructure in France.”



In Q2, XOM also expanded its earlier agreement with Global Clean Energy to purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel, and expects to begin commercial production in 2022. ExxonMobil is targeting the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of biofuels by 2025.



Yesterday, J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $65 (8.5% upside) on the stock. The analyst is bullish on the stock, as he believes that XOM has “traditionally differentiated itself with its defensive characteristics, owing to its well-integrated and diversified portfolio, including solid FCF generation and below-average financial leverage.”



Moreover, Gresh believes that with a “deep pool of assets that the company could sell and currently higher oil prices, we think that significant balance sheet progress can be made in coming years as well.”



Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Exxon Mobil, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 3 Buys and 7 Holds.



The average Exxon Mobil price target of $67.85 implies 13.2% upside potential from current levels.







Chevron Corp. (CVX)



Chevron Corp. is an integrated chemicals and energy company that engages in the manufacture, development, and transport of crude oil and natural gas. The company’s business segments include upstream, downstream, and chemical operations.



In the second quarter, the company posted impressive results, driven by improved market conditions, transformation benefits, and merger synergies. Chevron’s total revenues more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $37.6 billion, outpacing consensus estimates of $34.32 billion.



Adjusted earnings came in at $1.71 per share, versus the adjusted loss of $1.56 per share reported in the same quarter last year. That also beat analysts’ expectations of earnings of $1.50 per share.



Similarly to ExxonMobil, Chevron is also vulnerable to fluctuations in crude oil prices. Another potential risk factor for the stock is that as governments around the world focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, any regulatory changes could result in “curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible.”



Indeed, according to the TipRanks Risk Factors tool, CVX is at a high Legal and Regulatory risk of 29%, compared to the sector average of 19.8%.



However, Chevron is looking at mitigating this risk by investing more capital to grow lower carbon energy businesses. Earlier this month, the company unveiled an energy transition plan to triple its capital investment from $3 billion to $10 billion through 2028, and set new growth targets for hydrogen, renewable fuels, and carbon capture through 2030. (See Chevron stock chart on TipRanks)



Yesterday, J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh remained sidelined, with a Hold rating and a price target of $111 (7.4% upside) on the stock. Gresh is of the view that the “company’s dividend coverage breakeven [is] creeping closer to $55/bbl [barrel of crude oil] Brent, which is a bit above the group average.”



Following the Q2 results, Chevron declared a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share, payable on September 10 to shareholders of record as on August 19.



The analyst added, “When combined with buybacks, we have the company’s total return of capital yield looking at/below the group average through 2025. While the company could flex its balance sheet to return more capital to shareholders, we have leverage essentially in line with the group already, so we think that our assumed allocation looks fair.”



Return of capital is defined as the principal payments paid to owners of capital, that is, shareholders, unitholders, or partners.



While Gresh approves of Chevron’s higher spending when it comes to the energy transition, he also believes that “the ability to measure the returns on incremental spending will be long dated.”



Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Chevron Corp., with Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 9 Buys and 6 Holds.



The average Chevron Corp. price target of $123.36 implies 19.4% upside potential from current levels.







Bottom Line



When it comes to risk factors, it seems Chevron is more vulnerable to Legal and Regulatory risk compared to XOM, which is at Legal and Regulatory risk of 17%, below the sector average of 19.8%.



While analysts are cautiously optimistic about both stocks, it remains to be seen how Chevron’s energy transition move works out.
