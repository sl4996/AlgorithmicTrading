714,"When used safely and effectively, credit cards can facilitate some of the most useful debt for consumers, allowing the purchase of items based on the prospect of future income, as supported by modern theories of consumption. Thanks to a near-monopoly on the industry, Visa (V) is in the perfect position to fulfill this ever-growing need, reaping impressive margins and substantial earnings growth in Q2 in spite of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, leading to the suspension of operations in Russia. In fact, payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2021, increased 20% over the year, and payments volume for the three months ended March 31, 2022, increased 17% over the year, both on a constant-currency basis. International growth was also present in the quarter, as cross-border volume excluding transactions from Europe increased 38%. Subsequently, total processed transactions in Q2 were $44.8 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. In touting this performance, Chairman and CEO Alfred Kelly, Jr. stated, ""We had a very strong quarter amidst the invasion of Ukraine and our decision to suspend operations in Russia, with GAAP EPS up 23% and non-GAAP EPS up 30%. The Omicron variant impacts were short-lived, and the global economic recovery that began in the middle of last year continued."" Based on these results, he is confident that such performance is sustainable, explaining, ""We expect continued growth driven by a robust travel recovery and through the enablement of traditional and newer ways to pay globally."" Visa facilitates transactions between consumers, merchants, government entities, and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. With a mission to connect the world through secure and reliable transactions, Visa works toward empowering all individuals to partake in economic activities while creating the foundation for the future of money movement. I'm bullish on Visa. Strong Fundamentals Visa's increased volume from Payments certainly contributes to its fundamentals, creating enormous margins. To begin, gross, operating, and net margins are currently 97%, 67.6%, and 51.1%, respectively. Similarly, Visa also enjoys a return on equity of 40% and a return on assets of 17%. Further supporting this successful management of capital is the company's positive economic profit of 11%, or the difference between the return on invested capital and the weighted average cost of capital, which has been increasing over the last several years.  The combination of such factors justifies Visa's earnings growth in Q2, with net revenues of $7.2 billion, increasing 25% year-over-year. Moreover, GAAP net income was $3.6 billion or $1.70 per share, increases of 21% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year's results. Over the past three years, both revenue and EBITDA have grown at a 5.4% CAGR; the company was also profitable in all 10 of the previous years. With such favorable results, Visa has been able to increase shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends, thanks in part to $3.22 billion of free cash flow generated in Q2. In doing so, $2.9 billion of common stock was repurchased in Q2, while $802 million was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. This is not out of the ordinary for Visa, however, as dividends have grown a considerable 15.1% CAGR over the last three years, which is certainly attractive for shareholders. Looking toward the future, although the suspension of operations in Russia is expected to reduce second-half revenues by about 4%, third-quarter net revenues are expected to grow in the upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars, with domestic volume growth trends expected to be sustained. As such, full-year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high-teens-to-20% range is expected. An Entrenched Player Resulting from Wide Moats There are several sustainable competitive advantages that can be identified within Visa that facilitate its strong performance and dominating market share of 54% in terms of purchase volume. They create near-monopolies, as competitors such as Mastercard (MA), American Express (AXP), and Discover Financial Services (DFS) possess mere market shares of 22.94%, 18.99%, and 4.08%, respectively (as of the year ended December 31, 2020). To begin, Visa has established economies of scale and networking as the service becomes increasingly useful as more consumers use it and more businesses accept the service. Such a widespread network illustrates Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its users, essentially enabling exponential growth. Furthermore, there are several barriers to entry due to Visa's secured customer base, brand, and regulations. If new competitors attempted to enter the industry, it would be extremely difficult to establish anywhere near the number of relationships Visa has secured with both consumers and merchants. Even if achieved, it would require innovative services beyond that of Visa to convince customers to switch from a trusted and recognized brand. Finally, Visa's innovative potential was recently enhanced through the acquisition of Tink, an open banking platform allowing fintechs, merchants, and financial institutions to create financial products and services and move money, a perfect example of vertical integration. The company is already integrated with over 3,400 banks and financial institutions across Europe, which will foster the already-present growth in this region. The combination of these aspects in the business certainly creates a positive outlook toward the future. Wall Street's Take Wall Street seems to concur with this outlook, as Visa has a Strong Buy rating based on 14 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells. The average Visa price target of $267.81 suggests 25.8% upside potential, with a high price target of $310 and a low target of $235. Conclusion Whatever the macroeconomic conditions may be, consumers still need to spend money and require transactions that are majorly facilitated by credit cards to survive, as evident in the fact that consumer spending comprises approximately two-thirds of U.S. GDP. Visa has placed itself in the perfect position and consequently surrounded itself with economic moats to operate efficiently and effectively, not only being convenient and creating opportunities to spend for consumers and merchants but leading to substantial growth and attractive shareholder value.

732,"Visa (V), along with its industry companion Mastercard (MA), has essentially monopolized the payments processing network industry. Visa is operating a virtual toll booth for every single daily transaction, receiving a fee for all purchases its cardholders make. In other words, every time one swipes their cards for their daily coffee or automatically has their cards charged from Spotify and Disney+, Visa profits from frictionless and low-risk payment streams. This is the case even when one utilizes third-party platforms and wallets, like Apple Pay, for instance. Further, due to the company's prolonged relationships with most major global banking institutions, Visa features an incredible moat. While Visa was notably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, the company has recovered rather rapidly, with its financials reaching new record numbers in its latest results. On the one hand, the ongoing uncertainties attached to a rather shaky macro environment that could materially affect consumer spending have spooked investors. Thus, despite its record results, shares of Visa currently trade around 21% below their 52-week highs. On the other hand, the company's performance trajectory remains very promising, while elevated inflation levels can even result in increased profitability levels amid increased consumer spending on a nominal basis. With the stock's valuation returning toward reasonable levels following the ongoing correction tech equities have been experiencing, I remain bullish on Visa. Robust Growth Tailwinds Despite Uncertainties  Visa's Q2-2022 results established continuous performance improvements coming off of the pandemic's challenges. With all retail locations now back and running as well as robust e-commerce trading activity, Visa reported year-over-year Q2-2022 net revenue growth of 25%, to $7.2 billion. This celebrated a new quarterly net revenue record for the company. Increased revenues were primarily the result of positive advancements across the board. Payments volume grew 17% on a constant-currency basis, amid a complete recovery from Q2-2021 when many businesses were still being affected by the pandemic. Surprisingly enough, elevated payment volumes continue to be boosted by the gradual shift of the world turning cashless. While electronic payments have become the norm in multiple counties, cash is still prevalent in others, offering Visa a great growth opportunity. As management noted during the company's earnings call, Visa continued to see a strong rate of cash displacement in consumer spending. In Q2, Visa recorded debit cash volumes growth of 2%, while debit payments volumes rose by 12%. In fact, cash displacement persisted all around the world. Year-over-year, across debit and credit, the company recorded 7.9 billion more payment transactions and 16 million fewer cash transactions, which illustrates the shift toward a cashless world. This trend is highly prevalent in Latin America, as well as in Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, where physical cash is still being used widely. To breathe in some perspective, In the full year of 2019, cash comprised 59% of total payments volume. In Q2-2021, it was 50%, while in Q2-2022, it was 46%. Thus, we can see a clear trend when it comes to electronic payments adoption in emerging markets, which is set to benefit Visa for years to come. It's also worth noting that Visa's potent recovery has been partially supported by strong cross-border volume growth. Cross-border payment volumes rose 38% versus the comparable period last year. Excluding Europe, which, up until recently, was experiencing various COVID-19 restrictions, cross-border volumes rose 47% year-over-year. Regarding the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Visa has suspended its operations in Russia. However, as management noted, the company still expects accelerated revenue growth versus the pre-COVID-19 era moving forward, even without Russia. This is due to a vast worldwide opportunity across Visa's three growth drivers, including consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Regarding its profitability, Visa benefits from the benefits of its frictionless business model. Its gross margins are practically 100%. Consider Visa's cash flows as ""royalties"" yielded from each and every payment processed powered by Visa's network, with virtually no cost of goods sold. Thus, net margins remained at sky-high levels, coming in at 50.7% in fiscal Q2. Combined with robust revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.79, 29.7% higher compared to last year. Visa's business model is so scalable that it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that net margins could converge towards 60% or 70% over the long run, which is utterly remarkable considering the company's size. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, Visa has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $267.81, the average Visa stock forecast suggests 32.2% upside potential. Takeaway Despite the underlying concerns surrounding the current macroeconomic landscape, Visa's growth trajectory in a post-COVID world remains very impressive. With emerging markets gradually turning cashless and the traveling industry still recovering, resulting in sky-high cross-border volumes growth, the company continues to experience robust operating tailwinds. Following elevated profit levels and the stock's recent correction, Visa's forward P/E has approached substantially more reasonable levels lately. At a forward P/E of around 26.2, I would argue that Visa shares are rather attractively priced considering the underlying growth prospects, deep moat, and sky-high profit margins. Accordingly, I remain bullish on the stock. Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust. Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure",2022-05-24

805,"Global payments technology company Visa (NYSE: V) is riding on the recovery in the travel & hospitality sector, as well as cross-border payment volumes. The increasing shift to digital payments has been a boon for the credit card company. Nonetheless, like all other technology giants, Visa, too, has been a victim of circumstances this year. Inflation, interest rate hikes, recession fears, and geopolitical headwinds have led to a decline of 11% in Visa shares so far this year. Does this dip present a good buying opportunity for investors? To answer this question, we must dig deeper into the company's fundamentals to understand the business and its prospects better. Visa's Power Visa's revenues have been consistently increasing over the years, and its solid position in the digital payments domain and strong core business is expected to support sustained top-line growth in the years to come. Notably, cash transactions in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 were 16 million less in volume compared to last year's Q2. On the other hand, transaction volume with debit and credit cards was 7.9 billion more year-over-year. This speaks of the prospects of Visa in the digital payments space. The consistent flow of new partnership deals, renewed contracts with existing partners, consistent customer additions, and strategic acquisitions continue to boost the company's performance. In the second quarter of In Fiscal 2022, Visa reported $7.2 billion in revenues, which was 25% more than the prior-year quarter. Moreover, for the current quarter, management expects net revenues to be hovering around the ""upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars."" Visa's continued investments in technology to fortify its leading position in the payments market are noteworthy. With growing digitization, stronger security for online transactions has become the need of the hour. With this in mind, Visa is focusing on strengthening its information security and protecting consumer and merchant information. A compelling liquidity position combined with a healthy free cash flow is another reason for optimism. Despite a long-term debt much higher than its cash and cash equivalents ($17.5 billion in long-term debt against $12.3 billion of CCE as of March 31, 2022), Visa's commercial paper program provides a cushion of ample liquidity for general corporate purposes. Moreover, Visa has consistently paid dividends four times a year. The dividend amount has increased over the years. Currently, the dividend is $0.38 per share. Also, in December 2021, the company's board of directors authorized a new share buyback program worth $12 billion. Another point to ponder is that, despite being a great candidate to become a lender and open a new revenue stream of interest income, Visa does not lend and is not likely to lend in order to protect its 50% plus margins. This is because, unlike a lender, Visa does not need to allocate capital to buffer the business from loan losses in the event of recessions and economic downturns. Again, taking the current scenario and economic outlook into consideration, Visa is not too sensitive to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve or its multinational counterparts, as it is not a lender. This is because the company's revenues come from client services, cross-border transactions, licensing fees, and other non-interest fees. That's why the risks associated with interest payments are by cardholders. Wall Street's Take Wall Street analysts seem to have mixed opinions on Visa's prospects. Late in April, Evercore ISI analyst David Togut reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target on Visa to $310 from $304. Then, after a few days, Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat downgraded Visa to Hold from Buy and slashed the price target to $239 from $283, citing macroeconomic headwinds from Europe. Donat is worried about Europe witnessing a recession in 2023, which he believes can cut into payment transactions from the region. However, the consensus is bullish on Visa stock, with a Strong Buy rating based on 14 Buys and two Holds. The average Visa price target is $269.53, which indicates upside potential of 40.3% from current price levels. Parting Thoughts There can be no perfect company that has zero downsides to its prospects. It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of the company and look for upsides that are sustainable, which will help it overcome the troughs of the market. In this regard, Visa seems to be in a strong position, as its core business is likely to help the company pull through recessions, inflation, or any harsh economic event. Also, with the stock trading around the lowest levels in over a year, around 27 times its forward Fiscal 2022 earnings, the valuation seems to be at an attractively discounted level for a company that has consistently shown double-digit growth over the years.

1001,"It's hard to believe that shares of credit card behemoth Visa (V) have gone virtually nowhere for over two years now. The latest 18% pullback in the stock may be nothing more than a chance for long-term thinkers to top up their positions in one of the most stable earnings-growth darlings over the last few decades. Still, with interest rates rising and the possibility of economic growth stagnation, even quality payments players like Visa are unlikely to be immune from the pain. While Visa is a cash cow, even in late-cycle market environments, the stock may have gotten ahead of itself when peaking in the middle of last year. Indeed, Visa's sell-off, which saw the stock briefly enter bear-market territory, started well before the rest of the market sunk lower. The rise of disruptive forces in the payments space, specifically in BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later), caused substantial selling pressure in V stock. Though such BNPL firms have now shed a majority of their value, I still think it's wise to be more mindful of the growing number of potential competitors that could aim for Visa's share of economic profits in the future. Competition in Payments is Heating Up, but Visa is Holding Its Own Thus far, Visa has done a great job of defending its turf. However, as disruptive big-tech firms focus on disrupting the payments space, it could get tricky for Visa to fend off all rivals without taking a minor hit to its margins. Apple (AAPL) and its deeper dive into payments is a potential cause for concern. The firm's Apple Card has been an incredible success and could be a hint of what to expect from credit card offerings of the future. For now, Visa has been making the right investments, but if it fails to enhance the value proposition for its users, Visa stock may not be so quick to bounce back from its recent slide. Trading at around 34.3 times trailing earnings, Visa stock is a tad too rich for my liking, given the rocky macro environment and many rivals in payments. I am neutral on the stock. Visa Stock: An Economic Downturn Could Weigh Heavily It's hard to ignore the recession chatter these days, with the brief yield curve inversion and a Federal Reserve sounding as hawkish as ever. Though Visa stands to benefit from the continued shift towards online payments, the credit card company's economic sensitivity could work against it over the medium term if the Fed were to fail to engineer a ""soft landing."" Transaction volumes tend to be positively correlated to the magnitude of economic growth. These days, investors are less than sanguine about their expectations for the economy moving forward, which could impact their spending habits. Though seemingly unlikely at this time, a stagflationary environment could take a massive stride out of Visa's step and add even more selling pressure to its stock, as recent strength in payments is replaced by weakness. At a jarring 17.7 times sales, Visa stock may not be discounted by enough to factor in the chances of such a bear-case scenario. While a recession is a clear negative for Visa, it's arguably worse for the many BNPL up-and-comers that grew in popularity during the post-pandemic spending boom. As interest rates rise and spending cools, Visa appears to be in much better shape to weather such a storm. Visa Has Been Making the Right Moves  Visa knows that it risks losing considerable share as a market leader if it can't keep up with the times. Fortunately, Visa has been wheeling and dealing to stay on the right side of innovation. After having acquired Tink and CurrencyCloud last year, the company has been steadily adding to its fintech arsenal. Undoubtedly, Visa isn't just a sitting duck in the fintech arena; it's arguably one of the most intriguing innovators in the payments arena. On the credit card front, I'd look for Visa to include even more new perks and benefits alongside its existing cards to keep consumers from jumping ship or using alternative payment methods, like those offered by BNPL firms. Such added features will likely allow it to keep its margin profile attractive for longer, even as new rivals approach. Last year, Visa introduced intriguing perks like memberships to Shipt, Skillshare and Sofar Sounds for its Signature and Infinite line of cards. These are very compelling benefits that add value for cardholders. Looking ahead, Visa may wish to team up or even acquire its way to new perks that could improve the overall ""stickiness"" of its cards with younger consumers. I think the perks-based approach is a brilliant move by Visa that could make it more challenging for new rivals to compete. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, V stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 20 analyst ratings, there are 18 Buys and two Hold ratings. The average Visa price forecast is $275.88, implying upside potential of 33.3%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $235.00 per share to a high of $312.00 per share. The Bottom Line on Visa Stock Visa stock is hard to love with today's recession jitters. That said, the economy may not be nearly as fragile as some of the Fed doubters expect.

1061,"U.S. stock indices were on a downward slide last week as investors continued to sell their stocks. The earnings season so far has proven to be a mixed bag of results. Moreover, the banking sector, including large U.S. banks including Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) saw Q1 results that came in ahead of Street estimates, but profits saw a sharp decline. Other macroeconomic uncertainties continue to spook investors including supply chain constraints, the Fed’s attempts to rein in soaring inflation through hiking interest rates, elevated commodity costs, and rising bond yields. Add to this mix expensive gasoline and investors have been caught between a rock and a hard place with nowhere to go. As a StreetInsider report quoted Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial as saying, “There’s some concerns this earnings season. Expectations are the lowest since the recovery started and it's got investors cautious of how companies will step up to the earnings altar in the coming weeks.” In this scenario, the TipRanks Analysts’ Top Stocks can be a helpful tool for investors as it identifies stocks across eight different sectors that the best performing analysts on Wall Street are bullish about. These stocks have a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating and investors can further filter these stocks not only by sector but also by market cap. Today, let us look at the top three stocks in the payments processing domain across the Services sector and see why Wall Street analysts are bullish about these stocks. Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Earlier this month, Mastercard released its Mastercard Spending Pulse report. This report measures in-store and online retail sales across all modes of payment. The report indicated that excluding auto and retail, sales were up 8.4% year-over-year in March and 18% compared to spending before the pandemic in 2019, not adjusting for inflation. This report echoed what Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane has been saying; that payment processing companies like Mastercard and Visa (V) could benefit significantly from “strong payment volumes both globally and in the US as consumer spending remains strong despite continued concerns over inflation and supply chain issues.” Moreover, according to the analyst, as travel picks up, cross-border transactions could also see a recovery. Keane believes that both MA and V will see a quicker rise in revenues “over the mid-term” and these companies could benefit “from new tech payments use cases such as open banking and BNPL [Buy Now Pay Later].” As a result, the analyst is bullish on the stock with a Buy rating. Other Wall Street analysts also side with Keane and are upbeat about the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 unanimous Buys. The average Mastercard stock forecast is $435.31, implying an upside potential of 21.6% from current levels. Equifax (NYSE: EFX) Equifax is a data analytics and technology company that is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and provides consumer credit reports. The company currently operates in four global regions including North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America. The company’s products and services cater to clients across different verticals including mortgage, financial services, employers, government (state, federal and local), and consumers. Mortgage clients were the company’s biggest clients and made up 32% of EFX’s revenues of $4.92 billion in FY21. It is the headwinds from these mortgage clients that have kept Deutsche Bank analyst Faiza Alwy sidelined on the stock with a Hold rating. This fear has also been reflected in EFX’s stock price that has eroded by 23.8% year-to-date. Alwy expects that considering the scenario of rising interest rates where mortgage affordability could be an issue, mortgage inquiries could decline. This is also borne out by EFX as the company expects mortgage inquiries to drop by 21.5% this year. However, the analyst pointed out in her research report that EFX has spent the last four years in enhancing its cloud capabilities through an investment of $1.5 billion. In addition, Alwy stated that EFX has also spent more than $3.5 billion in “bolt-on M&A [mergers and acquisitions].” Alwy is of the view that considering more than half of EFX’s revenues come from the cloud, the enhanced cloud capabilities could provide EFX the “ability to quickly ingest and manage diverse data types and develop custom reports, products and solutions quickly and effectively.” While the company’s recent M&A activity could add “100-200 bps to its revenue growth, alongside annual organic growth of 7%-10%.” Alwy has a price target of $265, just above the lowest price target of $240 on Wall Street. Alwy’s price target implies an upside potential of 22.5% at current levels. The rest of the analysts on Wall Street, however, are optimistic about the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and two Holds. The average EFX stock forecast is $294.08, implying an upside potential of 35.9% from current levels. Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) Shift4 Payments, Inc. is a payment processing company that provides integrated payment processing and technology solutions. Its payments platform provides end-to-end payment processing that can be used across “multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and tablet-based) and industry verticals,” according to the company. The firm generates a majority of its revenues from processing fees paid by its merchants and which is a percentage of end-to-end payments volume. When merchants subscribe only to FOUR’s gateway, the company generates revenues from transaction fees that are a combination of a fixed fee for every transaction, and a monthly fee. Shift4 also charges a subscription fee through licensing subscriptions for its technology solutions. In Q4, the company’s end-to-end payments volume soared 97% year-over-year to $13.4 billion while gross revenues less network fees was up 65% year-over-year to $146.9 million. The company has been focused on its core strategic objectives including gaining market share reflected in the rise in payment volumes, investing in new products like the SkyTab point-of-sale, and expanding its global footprint through the Finaro acquisition. Early last month, the company announced the acquisition of Finaro for $525 million. Finaro is a cross-border eCommerce payment platform and a bank in the European Union (EU). This acquisition will be a revenue opportunity worth $5 billion for Shift4 in the European eCommerce market. This bright outlook for the stock has resulted in Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar resuming coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $81 on the stock. The analyst is positive about FOUR’s leadership position in two large end-markets including food and beverage and the hospitality business. Shirvaikar stated in his research note that FOUR’s “differentiated business model” has “led to a leadership position in two large end markets."" Other Wall Street analysts, however, are cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and three Holds. The average FOUR stock forecast is $75.09, implying an upside potential of 24.5% from current levels. Bottom Line From this list, it is obvious that these three payment services stocks stand to benefit from higher payment processing volumes and higher consumer retail spending.

1101,"Visa and Mastercard were among several corporations that severed ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. While Russia was an important market for these companies, analysts believe they will recover from the impact of the suspension of Russian operations on their financials. Visa (NYSE: V) Let’s begin with Visa. Last month Visa announced that it is suspending all its operations in Russia. And now, a recent Wall Street Journal report stated that Visa’s decision to pull out of Russia has eroded about 4% of its revenue. However, this shouldn’t worry investors much as the company’s CFO, Vasant Prabhu, remains confident of recovering the lost revenues within a year through other markets, the report highlighted. Notably, strong domestic volumes and a recovery in cross-border travel are driving growth at Visa. Visa’s CEO, Alfred Kelly, stated, “We remain confident that we are well-positioned, via our multi-pronged growth strategy, to deliver strong results well into the future.” He added that economies continue to improve worldwide, and cross-border travel will continue to recover with the easing of restrictions.  Echoing similar sentiments, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane stated that volumes are trending positively for Visa as cross-border travel is recovering. Further, Visa’s business remains resilient outside Russia. The analyst is bullish on Visa and has a price target of $270 (24.4% upside potential).  Along with Keane, Donald Fandetti of Wells Fargo also recommends a Buy on Visa stock. However, he lowered his estimates due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Fandetti stated that Visa generated about 4% of its net revenue from Russia in FY21. However, he added, “Visa is essentially able to offset all of the lost revenue, resulting in no negative operating leverage.”  Including those of Keane and Fandetti, Visa stock has received 16 Buy and two Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Further, the average price target of $277.13 indicates 27.7% upside potential over the next 12 months. Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Along with Visa, Mastercard suspended operations in Russia. Notably, Mastercard has operated in Russia for over 25 years. Moreover, Russia accounted for about 4% of its revenues, according to Fandetti. The analyst expects the suspension of operations in Russia and disruptions in Ukraine to impact Mastercard’s near-term financials, and he lowered his EPS estimates. However, Fandetti reiterated a Buy rating on Mastercard stock and a price target of $430 (22.1% upside potential). He stated, “We are keeping our Q1'22 estimate of $1.45 unchanged” and “believe strength in the core business can offset the loss of Russia and impact from Ukraine.”  Notably, improving spending trends (cross-border spending above pre-pandemic levels), new deals, and the expansion of products are supporting Mastercard’s financial performance. During the Q4 conference call, Mastercard’s CEO, Michael Miebach, stated, “Underlying spending trends remain strong.” This should benefit Mastercard.  Along with Fandetti, Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Mastercard stock. It has received 14 unanimous Buy recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Further, the average price target of $434.21 indicates 23.3% upside potential over the next 12 months. Bottom Line Both Visa and Mastercard lost about 4% of their net revenues due to the suspension of operations in Russia. However, strong cross-border spending and strength in their domestic businesses bode well for growth and will likely offset the loss of revenue. Further, e-commerce adoption, geographic expansion, and new products provide growth opportunities.  It’s worth noting that hedge funds have accumulated Visa and Mastercard stocks over the past quarter. Per TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool, hedge funds added 12.5M Visa shares in the last three months. Further, they accumulated 5.6M Mastercard shares during the same period.  Also, according to TipRanks' data-driven Smart Score rating system, both Visa and Mastercard are expected to outperform market expectations over the next 12 months.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (NDX) was the main winner, rising 1.9%. Despite the fact that recession fears have faded to some extent, the prospect of new sanctions being placed by the West on Russia adds to the market's existing concerns about inflation and supply-chain issues, which have been recurring themes in recent months. As a result, it appears that volatility will continue to prevail in April. In such an uncertain market, TipRanks' Smart Score System can help investors build a portfolio that can maximize their gains. This is a data-driven system that allows an investor to conduct more in-depth research of a company using eight major market criteria before assigning a score to the stocks on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the best. Using TipRanks' Top Smart Score Stocks, we chose two stocks that have recently received a score of ""Perfect 10."" Visa (V) Visa Inc., a financial services company, has received a ""Perfect 10"" rating since yesterday. The company has grown to be a prominent participant in the payments processing market. Visa’s multiple buyouts and affiliations with global banking institutions have set the road for long-term growth and steadily driven revenues. From a financial perspective, Visa’s performance was outstanding in the fiscal first quarter, with double-digit sales and earnings growth. The company's top-line revenue climbed 24% year-over-year to $7.1 billion, while adjusted profits per share increased 27% to $1.81 per share. Apart from the increase in earnings, Visa distributed $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The current dividend yield for the corporation is 0.61%. Notably, the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings will be released on April 27. Analysts are upbeat about this stock, with 16 Buys ratings and three Hold ratings. The shares are priced at $227.74 and the average V price target of $273.47 implies around 20% upside from that level. Chipotle (CMG) Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., a fast-food restaurant business that recently achieved a ""Perfect 10"" rating, is next on the list. Chipotle's brand has gained a lot of traction in recent years, with the company rapidly expanding its global footprint. The company posted strong fourth-quarter profits. Revenues increased 22% year-over-year to $2 billion, which was a fantastic achievement. In the meantime, adjusted earnings per share were $5.58, up 60.3% from the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, Chipotle maintains a strong financial position, which continues to impress investors. The corporation had $1.8 billion in cash and investments at the end of December. In addition, operating cash flow in 2021 was 1.3 billion, up 93% from the previous year. Also, the company repurchased $168.9 million in shares at an average price of $1,750 per share. Given the company’s strong capital and liquidity position, Chipotle will be able to maintain effective capital deployment actions in the future, thus improving shareholder value. The investors holding portfolios on TipRanks maintain a very positive outlook on CMG stock. According to the statistics, 7.1% of these investors boosted their Chipotle stock holdings in the last 30 days. Overall, with 20 analyst reviews on file, including 17 Buys and three Holds, Chipotle gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. Shares are priced at $1,610.75, and the average CMG price target is $1954.39, representing almost a 21% upside potential.

WSJ House Passes Bill To Cap Out-of-Pocket Insulin Costs To No More Than $35/Month The House of Representatives voted to approve legislation that would limit cost-sharing for insulin under private health insurance and Medicare. The vote was 232 (yes)-193 (no), with 12 Republican members joining their Democratic colleagues to pass the measure.

Bloomberg Oil Moves Towards Weekly Decline As US Plans Giant Reserve Release Crude Oil is headed for the most significant weekly loss in almost two years after the Biden administration ordered a release of U.S. strategic reserves amid rising crude prices.

The governor’s comments came after the entertainment giant opposed Florida’s controversial parental rights law, according to a report from Fox News. “What I would say as a matter of the first principle is I don’t support special privileges in law just because a company is powerful and they’ve been able to wield a lot of power,” said DeSantis, according to Fox News.

Coinbase CEO Slams EU Over New Proposals For Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Transactions; Parliament Passes It Anyway European Union lawmakers on Thursday voted in favor of an extension of anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that would effectively end anonymous transactions involving cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD. The proposals approved by the EU are aimed at extending AML requirements that apply to payments over 1,000 euros ($1,114) to cryptocurrencies, according to a report from CoinDesk. The proposals were supported by more than 90 lawmakers, while members of the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) opposed the changes saying it was a “de-facto ban” on self-hosted wallets, as per the report.

2239,"Visa (V) is a payments technology company that holds a very dominant position in the industry. We are neutral on the stock.



Competitive Advantage



Visa's main competitive advantage is that it has a dominant position in the payment market. It is in a duopoly, with Mastercard (MA) being its main competitor. 



Since both brands are highly recognized and trusted, it makes it more difficult for competitors to disrupt their dominance. Trust is especially important when it comes to handling financial transactions.



There are also a couple of ways to quantify a company's competitive advantage using only its income statement. The first method involves calculating the earnings power value (EPV).



Earnings power value is measured as adjusted EBIT after tax, divided by the weighted average cost of capital, and reproduction value can be measured using total asset value. If earnings power value is higher than reproduction value, then a company is considered to have a competitive advantage.



The calculation is as follows:



EPV = EPV adjusted earnings / WACC$172 billion = $12.9 billion / 0.075



Since Visa has a total asset value of $82.9 billion, we can say that it does have a competitive advantage. In other words, assuming no growth for Visa, it would require $82.9 billion of assets to generate $172 billion in value over time.



The second method is by looking at a company's gross margins because they represent the premium that consumers are willing to pay over the cost of a product or service. An expanding gross margin indicates that a sustainable competitive advantage is present. 



If an existing company has no edge, then new entrants would gradually take away market share, leading to decreasing gross margins as pricing wars ensue to remain competitive.



Although the image below appears to be volatile, we can see that gross margins have essentially remained flat over the past several years between 96-97%. As a result, Visa's gross margins indicate that a competitive advantage is present in this regard as well.







Risks



As dominant as Visa is, it still has some risks investors need to consider. To begin with, there has been some fear recently that companies such as Amazon can exert enough pressure on Visa to lower its fees on transactions. 



In addition, there are other risks associated with the company. According to Tipranks' Risk Analysis, Visa disclosed 22 risks in its most recent earnings report. The highest amount of risk came from the Legal & Regulatory category.



The total number of risks has remained relatively flat over time, as shown in the picture below.







Valuation



To value Visa, we will use the H-Model, which is similar to a three-stage DCF model. The H-Model assumes that growth will decelerate linearly over a specified period of time. We believe this is a reasonable assumption as companies gradually slow down as they mature. The formula is as follows:



Stock Value = (CF(1+tg))/(r-tg) + (CFH(hg-tg))/(r-tg)



Where:CF = cash flow per sharetg = terminal growth ratehg = high growth rater = discount rateH = half-life of the forecast period



For Visa, we used the following assumptions:CF = $6.83 per sharetg = 2.073%hg = 11.7% (based on analysts' estimates)r = 6.014%H = 5 years (we are assuming it will take 10 years to reach terminal growth)



As a result, we estimate that the fair value of Visa is approximately $260.32 under current market conditions.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Visa has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 12 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. The average Visa price target of $266.57 implies 24% upside potential.







Final Thoughts



Visa is a high-quality company that is undervalued under current market conditions. Nonetheless, we remain neutral on the stock because it is on a downtrend.

2327,"Visa (V) and its peer Mastercard (MA) have virtually monopolized the payments processing industry.



Visa is basically running the toll booth of daily transitions, benefiting from the full potential of its payments processing business model. Functioning as a toll booth whenever we swipe our cards for our daily coffee or through Netflix's (NFLX) automatic subscription payment, Visa enjoys slick and steady revenue streams.



Further, due to the company's long-term relationships with banking institutions all over the world (this is the case for Mastercard as well), Visa enjoys an exceptional moat.



Note that while some fintech companies such as Paypal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) may seem to be industry competitors, this is not the case. Fintech companies still employ Visa's very own processing network to complete transactions. Hence, if anything, the company is benefiting from the ongoing developments in the fintech industry.



Due to its market-dominant position and high-margin business model, Visa has produced market-beating returns over the years. That said, shares are not particularly cheap at the moment. While I am optimistic regarding the stock's long-term potential, I am neutral at the moment.



Improving Results



Visa's Q4 results showcased robust performance improvements from last year's adversely impacted results.



Due to a significant number of retail locations being forced to shut down in the midst of the pandemic last year, Visa's processing volumes had softened in the prior-year period. While the pandemic is still persisting, global restrictions have eased, resulting in Visa reporting year-over-year Q4 revenue growth of 29%, to $6.6 billion. This celebrates a new quarterly record for the company.



Increased revenues were attributed to advancements across the board. Payments volumes grew 17% on a constant currency basis, reaching $2.7 trillion, as retail locations began reopening and traveling volumes somewhat recovered.



Cross-border volumes improved significantly, growing 38% on a local currency basis. Excluding Europe, which still struggles with increased COVID-19 restrictions, cross-border volumes grew 36% year-over-year.



As I mentioned, Visa operates a frictionless business model. Its gross margins are practically 100%. Think of Visa's revenues as ""royalties"" acquired for every Visa-powered payment processed, with basically no cost of sales.



Hence, net margins hover at sky-high levels, reaching 54.6% in fiscal Q4. Visa's business model is scalable enough that it should come as no surprise if net margins end up growing beyond 60% at some point, as Visa matures and international transaction volumes keep increasing.



Capital Returns & Valuation



Powered by Visa's historically rich bottom line, management has been able to amply reward its shareholders through both dividends and stock buybacks.



The company has hiked its dividend annually for 13 years now, with its latest dividend per share increase being an impressive 17.2%.



Stock repurchases also remain robust. In its Fiscal Year 2021, Visa repurchased a total of 39.7 million shares at an average price of $219.34/share for $8.7 billion. Since this has been the main method for Visa to return cash to shareholders, the company has repurchased and retired around 25% of its outstanding stock since 2009.



That said, Visa's qualities do not come at a discount. The stock is currently trading with a forward P/E ratio of 31.2, which is somewhat higher than its historical range.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Visa has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 13 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. At $273.46, Visa's stock prediction suggests 24.4% upside potential.







Conclusion 



While Visa's results have improved significantly compared to last year, investors should be wary of the stock's expanded valuation. That said, investors should not anticipate a violent valuation compression either, in my view. This is due to the market being willing to pay a premium for quality growth companies these days.

Q4 2021 Earnings Results



In the fourth quarter of 2021, which ended September 30, 2021, key business metrics such as payment volume (up 17% year-over-year), total cross-border volume (up 38% year-over-year), and processed transactions (up 21% year-over-year), all meant that the company continued to recover from the damage caused by the pandemic.



In light of the above, adjusted earnings per share were $1.62, ahead of the consensus estimate by $0.08, on total revenues of $6.56 billion. Total revenue grew nearly 29% year-over-year, surpassing analyst forecasts by an average of $50 million.



The company returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through its own share repurchase and dividend payment programs. As for the dividend, executives have increased the distribution, and the quarterly dividend of $0.375 the company paid per common share on Decemver 7 reflects a 17.2% increase from the previous payment.



Positive Outlook



Mass vaccination is making good progress, so are pharmaceutical companies such as Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) in developing treatments to prevent serious illness from COVID-19. Although currently there are many infections from Omicron, the situation should improve.



After this pandemic wave, others may follow, but likely at a low intensity, so the need to reapply lockdowns and restrictions to stem the spread of the virus will diminish, fueling economic recovery.



So many sectors, such as HORECA (hotels, restaurants, catering) and cross-border airlines, will experience fewer and fewer interruptions in the future. These sectors are expected to give a huge boost to credit card and debit card payments going forward.



Wall Street’s Take



In the past three months, 13 Wall Street analysts have issued a 12-month price target for V. The company has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 13 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings.



The average Visa price target is $273.46, implying 25.5% upside potential.







Summary



Had COVID-19 not impacted digital payments, Visa would likely have reached new highs after the mid-July peak. However, the situation with the coronavirus will improve globally, giving strength to the share price recovery.

2394,"Headquartered in California, Visa (V) offers digital payment and credit/debit card services worldwide. I am bullish on the stock.



There's no denying that V stock was directionless in 2021. It's been frustrating for the shareholders, and you might be tempted to just give up on Visa and look elsewhere for yield.



Speaking of yield, Visa has only a 0.61% forward annual dividend yield at the moment. Therefore, investors will want to look for reasons to expect share-price appreciation.



Thankfully, there are recent developments that should provide some hope and excitement for prospective and current Visa shareholders. In the final analysis, traders should prepare for a fresh start and higher share prices in the coming year.



Many Currencies, Many Clients



One thing's for sure: today's top financial institutions must think globally, in order to remain competitive. With a recently completed acquisition, Visa has achieved its global ambitions, to the benefit of all stakeholders.



Specifically, Visa finalized its acquisition of Currencycloud. This is a global platform that enables banks and fintech businesses to provide foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments.



Currencycloud and Visa already had a strategic partnership in effect, but this buyout will enable Visa to leverage Currencycloud’s cloud-based platform.



Believe it or not, that platform supports over 500 banking and technology clients, with a reach spanning more than 180 countries.



Moreover, Currencycloud has processed more than $100 billion in transactions since 2012.



Thus, there's no need for Visa to build a cross-border payments platform from scratch, when the company could instead just buy out a market-niche leader like Currencycloud.



A Buyback Juggernaut



While Visa isn't the most generous dividend payer, investors should know that the company is apparently finding other ways to deliver value to the shareholders.



In particular, an 8-K SEC filing reveals that Visa's board of directors approved a new $12-billion share buyback program.



The company isn't a novice when it comes to stock-share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Visa bought back $3.1 billion of its own shares.



With the renewed commitment to repurchasing the company's own stock shares, Visa is effectively affirming its confidence in its financial position.



With the board's new authorization, total available fund for buybacks will be $13.2 billion. Also, the board's most recent authorization for share repurchases reportedly has no expiration date.



Just as importantly, Visa remains in a firm financial position and can easily afford to buy its own stock shares. At the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, Visa had cash and cash equivalents valued at $16.5 billion.



Wall Street’s Take



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, V is a Strong Buy, based on 13 unanimous Buy ratings. The average Visa price target is $273.46, implying 25.65% upside potential.







The Takeaway



Admittedly, Visa isn't known as the dividend king. On the other hand, maybe it's in the process of becoming a ""buyback boss.""



Furthermore, the Currencycloud acquisition means that Visa doesn't have to develop its own global, cross-border payments platform from scratch. Instead, Visa simply bought out an already known and developed business.



Consequently, V stock shouldn't be directionless in the coming year like it was in 2021. Visa is demonstrating its commitment to the shareholders in various ways, while boosting confidence and clearing the runway for higher share prices.

2399,"Visa (V) stock was long overdue for a big relief rally, and it appears to finally be getting one, now up around 14% from its recent bottom of around $190 per share. The bounce-back from Visa's bear market moment was quick, and if you flinched, odds are you missed the ricochet. 



With continued pressure facing the incumbent payments players, it may be wiser to take a raincheck on Visa stock, as the same pressures that weighed a week ago are still present. BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) firms could eat away at the handsome margins enjoyed by dominant credit card companies like Visa. Meanwhile, consumer spending uncertainties are another hazy cloud that makes Visa a tough hold, going into 2022.



After doing nothing year-to-date, V stock has given earnings a chance to catch up. Still, real headwinds could continue to act as a drag on the credit card giant as it grapples with one of the first real tests to its dominance in the payments space.



Undoubtedly, there's a ton of economic profit to be had in payments. With hungry fintech firms willing to settle for far lower margins in today's low-rate environment, Visa had better brace for further impact. In any case, I think it will be increasingly more difficult for Visa to maintain its impressive margins in the face of new rivals. As such, I am bearish on Visa stock at around $216 and change per share. The valuation remains too steep for me to get behind, and I think the recent bounce is overdone.



Visa: A Proven Leader, but Stiff Competition in Payments Tech Space



Payments are long overdue for disruption. With intriguing innovations in the payments space quickly gaining popularity, Visa not only needs to pivot to adapt, but it needs to go the extra mile to bring the fight to its much smaller peers. 



In any case, higher investment and a potential race to the bottom in terms of fees appear like an unstoppable downward pressure point on operating margins.



Visa is a company that has been innovating at a solid pace. However, its own Installments service doesn't appear to be a magic solution. BNPL products could weigh on the amount of credit card debt consumers accumulate, even if consumer spending trends remain favorable, moving forward.



At writing, Visa stock trades at a pricy 37.90 times trailing earnings and an equally hefty 19 times sales. Such a valuation doesn't leave much in the way of error, especially in the face of great macro uncertainty and some rivals growing at a scarily fast pace in payments.



Could Crypto's Growing Popularity Weigh on Visa Long-term?



Indeed, continued adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) could also become a growing thorn in the side of some of the traditional payment plays. 



Similarly to Visa Installments, the firm's BNPL answer to rising competition in the growing popularity of interest-free financing for small consumer purchases, Visa has a crypto offering of its own. The company has an upcoming Coinbase (COIN) debit card that allows its users to spend either cryptocurrencies or U.S. dollars while also earning rewards. 



We all know and love those cash-back Visa cards. With the Coinbase Visa debit card, users can earn crypto rewards. Indeed, the card is as intriguing as it sounds, but it will likely represent just a drop in the bucket for the credit-card giant.



Although crypto is nowhere close to replacing traditional payment methods, the disruptive asset is worth watching.



Wall Street's Take



According to TipRanks’ consensus analyst rating, V stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 18 analyst ratings, there are 13 Buy recommendations.



As for price targets, the average Visa price target is $273.46. Analyst price targets range from a low of $240.00 per share to a high of $305.00 per share.



The Bottom Line on V Stock



Visa is atop the payments industry, and the lead is arguably the company's to lose. All of the innovation in the payments space will pave the way for disruption. 



Even if Visa can out-innovate its opponents, it's going to be harder to take share. While it does have networking effects, the allure of up-and-comers and consumer distaste for its history of commanding high fees could work against Visa in the future.



Although Visa has less to worry about over the near future, the longer-term trend remains uncertain, given the profound magnitude of change the payments space is bound to experience throughout the decade. With such a rich valuation, it's too tough to get behind Visa stock, especially after its recent relief rally.

A second dip in March took about 5% of the company's value in one day. However, late April saw a new high for the year. Mid-May's moves wiped out that high. 



Then, Visa started a 10-week climb to its highs for the year. Despite the gains, it immediately started losing ground after that high. Late October brought signs of a recovery, but the share price once again fell. The company lost nearly 10% of its value in two days at one point. 



The second half of November was a catastrophe for Visa, but going into December, the company recovered to where we are today.



The latest news gives Visa a particular edge. The company announced plans to top up its share buyback plan by a hefty $12 billion. That brings the total amount to $13.2 billion. That's an 11-fold increase. Reports noted that there was no expiration date on the buyback plan, which means Visa will be able to repurchase those shares at whatever rate it pleases up to the limit of the fund.



Is Visa Worth Considering? Maybe.



Just from a straight mechanical viewpoint, right now, Visa looks highly attractive. It's barely two weeks off its lows for the year. That dip in November actually took the company below that low point back in February. It's come back significantly since, but we're still well off the highs for the year. In fact, we're still well below the average price target. Those are definitely solid points in favor of a Buy rating.



Visa's dividend history and viability as an income stock are also solid. The company has a regular quarterly dividend, and it's been raised annually for the last two years.







Protecting that dividend, however, requires some solid advancement toward the future. Visa is already widely recognized as one of the two biggest credit card forces out there, along with Mastercard (MA). 



The company worked to cement that status further with plans for a new cryptocurrency service just weeks ago. The service would offer advising for both financial institutions and individual merchants looking to get more connected with cryptocurrency.



Additional reports that Visa may be about to resolve issues over fees with Amazon (AMZN) may be about to help further. However, there are some less positive issues afoot; a resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe won't be helpful. However, even there, it may mean a boost in online shopping, which will likely be helpful.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Visa has a Strong Buy consensus rating. That's based on 13 Buys assigned in the past three months. The average Visa price target of $276.46 implies 30.8% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $255 per share to a high of $305 per share.







Concluding Views



Several possible tailwinds are on hand to give Visa a hand in the coming days. Those alone would make Visa worth considering as a buy. However, it's the massive new buyback plan that really makes Visa attractive. The company plans to take about 2.5% of its market cap off the field. As anyone who's tried to buy an Xbox Series X knows, scarcity improves value.



The calculus here is simple. Take the buyback plan plus Visa's other moves, and the result is a serious investment target. Plus, you can make that buy at a comparative value. The company isn't quite at its lows for 2021, but it's not that far away. Essentially, a great value seems to be waiting for Visa investors here. Even at the three-digit share price, investors are likely to get full value.

I am neutral on V stock, as despite its strong fundamentals it is now traded at a premium. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks) 



Visa Business Highlights



Visa makes its profits by selling services as an intermediary between financial institutions and merchants, whereas merchants need strong consumer spending and strong economic conditions to thrive. 



The company reported that the U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI) rose to 111.9 points in November, which was the second consecutive month of acceleration in consumer spending momentum. Levels of the SMI above 100 signal strong momentum. 



The SMI in October was reported to be 110.6, and was up 2.1 points from September.



Visa has developed a positive attitude towards the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and this is reflected by its decision to launch its Crypto Advisory Services, Global Crypto Advisory Practice, which falls within its Visa Consulting & Analytics (VCA) division, supporting the path to digital money. 



It was stated in this crypto-related announcement that “The case for crypto is getting stronger for financial institutions; new global research finds nearly 40% of crypto owners would be likely to switch primary banks to one that offers crypto products.”



Visa has an extensive partnership globally with more than 60 cryptocurrency platforms and a global network of both experts and consultants. These can help financial institutions offer their customers services such as NFTs, or exposure to digital currencies. Visa believes that the crypto market ecosystem may become mainstream.



This is however, a bold and risky business strategy especially as regulatory woes are lingering over the cryptocurrency market. Not just in the U.S. but on a global level, as most countries have yet to formally accept cryptocurrencies as an official means of payment, except for El Salvador, which was a pioneer in making Bitcoin legal tender.



The high volatility of the whole cryptocurrency market is a key risk to Visa.



Visa has been supporting the growth of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) business solutions. In late October, it announced an expanding list of companies such as issuers, acquirers, and fintech firms that use its technology and network to offer these attractive BNPL options to their customers.



The leading global payments technology company has announced its “Visa Eco Benefits,” a “new package of sustainability-focused benefits for account issuers designed to enable and encourage their cardholders to engage in sustainable consumption behaviors.”



Not all business news is positive though, as Visa has a severe business issue with Amazon (AMZN) which intends to ban the U.K. from the usage of Visa’s credit cards next month, due to the rising cost of accepting credit card payments.



Visa: Strong Earnings



As a result of a strong full-year 2021, Visa in late October increased its quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.375 per share, a 17.18% increase. For the full-year 2021 net revenues increased 10% to $24.1 billion,  GAAP net income increased 13% to $12.3 billion, and GAAP earnings per share increased 15% to $5.63.



For Q4, Visa reported a year-over-year increase of 29% to net revenues ($6.6 billion), a 68% increase in GAAP net income to $3.6 billion, and a 70% increase of GAAP EPS to $1.65.



All key business drivers witnessed an increase for the full-year 2021, with Processed Transactions and Payments Volume rising 17% and 16% respectively, being the top performers. Cross-Border Volume Total rose 9%, whereas Cross-Border Volume Excluding Intra-Europe was a laggard, rising only 1%.



V Stock: Relatively Expensive



Data from Simply Wall Steet shows that V stock is relatively expensive based on its P/E Ratio (37.1x) compared to the U.S. IT industry average (35.9x). 



It is also expensive based on its P/EG Ratio (1.6x), and relatively overvalued based on its P/B Ratio (12.4x), compared to the U.S. IT industry average (4.8x).



Wall Street Take



Visa has a Consensus Rating of Strong Buy, based on 13 unanimous Buys. The average Visa price target of $276.46 represents 30.1% upside potential.

Visa Conducts Global Survey



The launch follows the company’s survey of over 6,000 financial decision makers across eight nations — Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S. — about crypto awareness.



The survey found that nearly 33% of the respondents have dealt with crypto directly. It also found that around 40% of crypto owners are likely to change their primary bank in the next 12 months to the one that offers crypto-related products.



Management Comments



The European Head of Visa Consulting & Analytics, Claudio Di Nella, said, “We’ve seen a material shift in our clients’ mindset in the last year, from a desire to explore and experiment with crypto, to actually building a strategy and product roadmap.”



The Deputy CEO, Visa, Europe, Antony Cahill, said, “As consumers change their approach to investing, where they bank, and their views on the future of money, every financial institution will need a crypto strategy.”



Analysts’ Recommendation



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 unanimous Buys. The average Visa price target of $276.46 implies 33.3% upside potential. Shares have lost 10.6% over the past six months.



Website Traffic



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Visa’s performance.



According to the tool, compared to the previous year, the company’s website traffic registered a 12.4% decrease in global visits in November. Moreover, the website traffic has declined nearly 6% year-to-date against the same period last year.

2630,"Shares of credit services company Visa (V) have continued to falter over the past few weeks, now down about 22% from all-time highs. The COVID-19 Omicron variant news certainly hasn't helped Visa stock either, causing it to drop further. 



Undoubtedly, payment players threaten the credit card giant's previously insurmountable moat, with no-interest installments (Buy Now Pay Later) that have been a hit among consumers of late.



While consumer payment firms like Visa have their own BNPL services, it's evident that BNPL could leave a long-lasting dent in the profitability prospects of Visa's flagship business. Indeed, if one can avoid racking up high-interest credit card debt, one will. With many BNPL options popping up, Visa has an issue on its hands, with no easy solutions.



Undoubtedly, the recent plunge into bear market territory may very well be warranted. That said, Visa does have many levers it can pull to offset current pressures. 



Still, I am bearish on V stock, as the company will need to do more to justify its hefty 17.3x sales multiple in the face of potential headwinds. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Not only is the payments space becoming crowded, but consumer appetite could be curbed once again, as consumer spending exhausts and a new variant threatens to cause further economic pain.



Visa's Payment Volumes Remain Robust, but for How Long?



For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, Visa revealed some pretty decent results that saw payment volumes rise 17% year-over-year.



Indeed, Visa benefited from a pick-up in consumer spending across the board, both online and offline. Management was confident with its guidance, calling for the top-line to grow at the higher end of its range for Fiscal 2022. The solid guidance also came alongside a 17.2% hike to its quarterly dividend.



With the growth bar set high, though, the stakes are pretty high, with rivals so hungry to take share. Arguably, Visa's dominant position atop its market makes it vulnerable to disruptive forces, making further growth and margin expansion quite tough as other up-and-coming payment firms partner up with major retailers such as Amazon (AMZN).



Amazon's Disruptive Impact



In what was a tough blow, Amazon recently announced its plans to stop accepting U.K.-issued Visa credit cards. There's no question that there are many retailers in the sea to team up with. That said, all it takes is one big fish like Amazon to turn the tables. Right now, the tables could turn against Visa as the race to partner up intensifies.



In any case, the surprising announcement could overshadow Visa's remarkable earnings beats. While it's tough to tell when Visa could start really surrendering meaningful share to rivals, not having such a dominant e-commerce behemoth completely on your side ought to be seen as a major negative. 



To add even more salt to the wound, Amazon noted that it believes fees on Visa credit cards are too high. Amazon certainly isn't wrong to have such beliefs.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Visa earns a Strong Buy consensus rating. Out of 14 analyst ratings, there are 14 unanimous Buy recommendations.



The average Visa price target of $277 implies 41.1% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $255.00 per share to a high of $305.00 per share.







The Bottom Line on Visa Stock



For now, Visa will need to innovate to maintain its dominance. I don't see a clear pathway for continuing its incredible growth streak. As such, I'm staying on the sidelines, as the recent 20% decline may not be as significant a bargain as some value hunters may think.

2643,"Shares of Visa (V) were in correction territory before the Black Friday news of a new COVID variant on a day of limited volume took the Dow down 900 points. 



The market was already concerned about the emerging competitive threat from Buy Now Pay Later, Visa losing its Amazon UK business, and a delay in return to normal travel leading to lower cross-border payment volume. 



Despite these headwinds, I am bullish on Visa. Shares are changing hands at under $200 and are down over 20% from their 52-week high. This looks like an opportunity to buy a blue chip payments technology giant at a discounted price. Analysts view Visa as a Strong Buy, with a $277 average price target representing 41.2% upside from current levels.   



People talk about Visa getting disrupted by fintech companies, but they overlook the fact that Visa is a fintech company itself. Whether it's blockchain technology or buy now pay later, Visa has a hand in all of the technologies that doubters say will disrupt it.



Buy Now Pay Later 



The rise of buy now pay later (also referred to as BNPL) players like Affirm (AFRM) and Square’s (SQ) Afterpay is often brought up as a threat to Visa, but in reality, Visa is already involved in BNPL. 



CEO Alfred Kelly has stated that while Visa doesn’t know where BNPL will end up, “We are attacking that like we attack crypto and other things and assuming that it’s going to be successful and that we want to lean in heavily and be in the middle of it and be a driver of what’s going to potentially happen… We have a strategy of working with both third party providers as well as offering our own proprietary platform that would allow issuers to offer their own BNPL platform.” 



This seems to be the right approach and one that is underappreciated by the market. If Visa can leverage its scale and technology to offer a better or cheaper ‘white label’ BNPL solution to merchants, it could become a growth driver for the company instead of a threat. 



Furthermore, it’s important to remember that BNPL doesn’t usually bypass the card network rails entirely -- customers making an installment payment via a debit card is still a fee-generating transaction for Visa. As an added bonus, what was once a single transaction with one fee might now become a series of transaction as the customer pays for the item over time via multiple installments, using a Visa card for the payment each time.     



Cryptocurrency



Longer-term, I see cryptocurrency as a trend Visa will have to be more mindful of than BNPL, but even here, many investors underappreciate how involved in crypto and blockchain technology Visa is. 



Even Strike, the company that made headlines with its innovative ‘Pay Me in Bitcoin’ feature, offers Visa debit cards in some areas. Whether its purchasing a CryptoPunk to explore the NFT market, partnering with various crypto platforms to offer crypto-linked credit and debit cards, developing settlement in the USDC stable coin, or investing in the seed rounds of crypto start ups, Visa is being proactive in treating the rise of cryptocurrency as an opportunity rather than a threat.



Amazon Ban, Fed Now, COVID



Let’s briefly address the other headwinds that Visa is facing. 



If Amazon (AMZN) does ban payments from Visa credit cards because of what it says are overly high fees, payments from Visa debit cards will still be accepted, so Visa will keep getting paid albeit at a slightly lower rate. 



Furthermore there is the chance that the dispute between the two mega caps will be resolved, as is often the case in these situations. In any case, Morgan Stanley predicts that Amazon UK makes up about 0.1% of Visa’s business. 



We don’t know much about the outbreak of this new COVID variant yet, but even if there are some new travel bans that curtail some of Visa’s lucrative cross-border payments business, we are two years into the pandemic and I don’t foresee much of an appetite for full lockdowns that would really curtail economic activity returning at this point in time. Even if there are some sort of restrictions, people will increase their online shopping like they did during 2020. 



FedNow, an instant payments network that The Federal Reserve is planning to introduce in 2023, is a competitive threat and could disrupt the rails networks that companies like Visa and Mastercard (MA) have built. This is indeed a threat but is further out in the future and it remains to be seen how it will be implemented. The incumbent networks are well-established brands that consumers and merchants alike have used and trusted for decades.  



Wall Street's Take



As stated above, analysts view Visa as a Strong Buy. Despite the headwinds, all 14 analysts covering Visa rate it a Buy. 



Interestingly, even the lowest analyst price target of $255 is 30% higher than the current price. The highest price target of $305 indicates 55.5% upside from here. 







Conclusion



Visa is proactively addressing many of the challenges and competitive threats that some investors are worried about, and these challenges have created the opportunity to buy a blue chip company for a discounted price. 



It is quietly a fintech player itself, innovating in the background and working with fintech disruptors as opposed to being disrupted by them.

2644,"Global payments company Visa Inc. (V) has reportedly shown concern about India backing its local payments company RuPay. India is a key market for Visa and the payments giant is worried that India’s “formal and informal” backing for RuPay hampers both its current and future business potential. Shares of Visa are up 1.1% during pre-market trading at the time of writing.



RuPay's Dominance



According to Reuters, Visa complained to the U.S. government about the absence of a “level playing field” in India during an August 9 meeting between the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives, including Visa CEO Alfred Kelly. 



However, Visa has publicly refrained from acknowledging the issue and RuPay's dominance, which is backed by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



Similarly, Mastercard Inc. (MA) had also raised similar concerns with the USTR in 2018, stating that the Indian Prime Minister was promoting the local network in the name of nationalism. “Everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country, we can use RuPay card to serve the nation,” Modi said in a speech in 2018.



India and its leaders continue to support RuPay by directing banks to issue RuPay cards and promote a RuPay-based card for public transportation payments. As per the most recent statistics, RuPay is considered to be the largest debit card issuer. Meanwhile, in the credit card segment, both Visa and Mastercard together process more than 70% of the total transactions.



According to the Reserve Bank of India, the actual number of transactions carried out via credit cards was 185 million, and via debit cards was 901 million in September 2021. This translates into a total transaction value of $53.32 billion ($1=INR 75). The statistics prove the massive market opportunity of the Indian payments network, which Visa could stand to lose should RuPay continue to capture the market share at an accelerating pace.



Additionally, in 2018, the Indian central bank directed the payments networks to store payments data “only in India” citing “unfettered supervisory access”. In July 2021, Mastercard was banned indefinitely from issuing new cards in India because it did not comply with the 2018 ruling. The ban on MA means that Visa and RuPay stand to gain an incremental share in the market.

2654,"Visa (V) was in the news for all the wrong reasons last week. After Visa hiked its transaction processing fees, Amazon (AMZN) announced that it would no longer accept payments on transactions from Visa credit cards issued in the U.K., as of January 19, 2022. 



“The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for Amazon told Bloomberg.



This has stoked investor concerns and has led to the stock falling by approximately 3.3% in morning trading Friday.



Are these investor concerns valid? Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev doesn’t think so.



The analyst believes that its current dispute with Amazon is “transitory” given the management commentary and the resolution of a similar dispute with Walmart Canada (WMT).



In fact, Dolev quoted Visa vice-chairman and CFO, Vasant M. Prabhu who commented on the dispute, “We've resolved these things in the past, and I believe we'll resolve them in the future ... It is our expectation that there will be a resolution so that UK consumers are not impacted.”



The analyst also addressed some other key investor concerns about the stock in his report.



Still Room for Cash-to-Card Runway



Dolev thinks that there is still plenty of room for growth post-COVID when it comes to cash-to-card conversions.



The analyst pointed out the data that indicated that as of “3Q21, Visa and Mastercard (MA) volumes accounted for 47% of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure].” Moreover, Dolev added that around $8 trillion of total $15 trillion to $16 trillion annualized PCE is still not card-based. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



He commented further, “Plus, with the US accounting for 20-25% of global GDP exChina [excluding China], the implied global un-vended opportunity for V/MA may be 4x larger, or $30-35tn.”



E-Commerce



Investors have also been worried that after the COVID-induced spurt in e-commerce growth that benefited Visa, this could be the end of the e-commerce runway.



Dolev acknowledged that the boost from the e-commerce business is particularly important for Visa as it “captures a much larger share (est. 3x higher) of e-commerce checkout vs. brick-and-mortar because cash is typically not an option in e-comm.”



However, the analyst brushed aside investor concerns as assessing U.S. retail spend data “suggests that: (1) E-commerce still accounts for 13% of total retail spend. (2) The reopening is triggering a reset back towards card-present, which creates more room for consistent increases in e-comm penetration, potentially benefiting Visa.”



BNPL



The rise of Buy Now, Pay Later has resulted in investors being concerned over the future of card companies like Visa.



Here, the analyst cited data from Australia that has been an early adapter of BNPL, and as such could indicate the potential future behavior of this trend in the U.S.



Dolev said that this data indicated that “while credit volumes are trending lower, this is being more than offset by rising debit volumes, which drives up overall card volumes.”



Alfred F. Kelly, Visa chairman, and CEO, commented on its earnings call about how the company plans to address the BNPL trend, “But we are bringing scale to disrupters. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL fintech partners. The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms.”



As a result, Dolev remains upbeat about the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $255 (29.5% upside).



Rest of the Street is also bullish about Visa, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on unanimous 14 Buys. The average Visa price target of $277 implies 40.7% upside potential to current levels.

Recent Controversy



Amazon (AMZN) has barred U.K. Visa credit card usage from its platform due to the apparently exorbitant transaction fees Visa charges to its clients.



According to an Amazon spokesperson: ""These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.""



This is likely a bit of a non-event; it's more of a case where Amazon is exercising its bargaining power, and it's doubtful that Visa will experience long-term implications from this situation.



According to Visa's CFO, Vasant Prabhu: ""We've resolved these things in the past, and I believe we'll resolve them in the future.""



Another issue that investors are concerned about is the rising COVID-19 cases in Europe. When looked at objectively, the company has shown that it can cope with pandemic restrictions; as a matter of fact, Visa has benefited from COVID's online shopping surge and has produced a 10.34% year-over-year increase in revenue.



Stellar Q4 Results



The digital payments pioneer produced stellar results in its Q4 report, which got released in October.



Visa beat its revenue target by $50 million and its EPS target by $0.08. The firm managed to benefit from its diverse range of revenue streams and increases in consumer spending during a period of quantitative easing.



To break the quarter down into further detail. Visa's payment volume rose by 17%, its cross-border volume rose by 38%, and processed transactions increased by 21%.



Key Metrics



From an investors' vantage point, Visa is in great shape. The firm managed to produce 45.9% in year-over-year gains in operating cash flows, increasing its intrinsic value significantly.



Furthermore, Visa's ROE and EPS ratios are anticipated to grow by 12.9% and 18.7% within the next year, which could spur on the stock's growth.



Wall Street's Take



Analysts across Wall Street remain adamant that Visa is a Strong Buy. All 14 analysts who've covered Visa stock have placed Buy ratings on the asset with an average price target of $277, which represents upside worth 36.3%.







Concluding Thoughts



Visa stock should be able to shake off the recent controversy surrounding its Amazon partnership and COVID speculation. The company is in great shape, and so is its stock.

2732,"Visa’s (V) stock tumbled 4.7% at market close yesterday after Amazon (AMZN) threatened to limit its ties with the electronic payments giant over the latter’s transaction processing fees hike.



Visa’s exorbitant fee hike led Amazon to announce that it will not accept payments on transactions from Visa credit cards issued in the U.K., starting from January 19, 2022. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for Amazon told Bloomberg. Moreover, the high fee is resulting in inflated prices for online shoppers.



It seems that Visa’s timing to hike its fees was wrong and came at a time when inflation is looming on the global economy.



See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks >>



What This Setback Means for Visa



As a global payments leader with numerous key partnerships, Amazon’s payment transactions using its U.K.-issued credit cards make up a very small part of its global transaction volume. Therefore, the limit issued by Amazon is not likely to weigh heavily on the company’s top-line or profitability.



Baird analyst David Koning, who maintains a Buy rating on Visa, believes that the closure of Visa’s business from its U.K. credit cards on Amazon’s platform won’t have any credible impact on Visa’s yields due to the fact that shoppers on Amazon can still use Visa debit cards, which will likely compensate for the loss. Moreover, he estimates Visa’s business from the U.K. to account for only about 6% of its global yield, a fraction of which comes from purchases on Amazon.



Nonetheless, Amazon’s stand against growing processing fees by payments partners represents a milestone in the world of retailers. For a long time now, the high fees by payment companies have been notorious for slimming down the profit margins of retailers. Therefore, it may be worrisome for Visa if Amazon’s step becomes a trailblazer and other enterprises follow suit.



Moreover, this stand may make Visa think twice before making any more fee hikes, as that might meet with serious objection globally.



Visa Website Traffic Falls



A key measure of a company’s popularity is the number of visits to its website. Being a digital payments company, we can safely say that traffic to Visa’s website may give us a fair idea of how the company is doing in the eyes of consumers.



TipRanks’ new Website Traffic tool, which sources its data from Semrush (SEMR), helped us see the website traffic volume and trends for Visa.



As we delved into the data, we saw that so far into Q4, the consolidated virtual visits to Visa’s website seem to be going downhill. Moreover, at the end of Q3, total estimated visits to the website from all devices have declined 9.51% sequentially.



Furthermore, when we looked at the quarter-to-date period of last year and compared it with the quarter-to-date period of this year, we saw a 20.72% drop in total estimated  visits to Visa’s website. Additionally, total estimated visits on a year-to-date basis have declined 5.29% from last year’s corresponding period.



This may be an indication of Visa’s falling popularity among the growing inflow of new entrants into the digital payments market. Also, Visa’s higher transaction fees might also have a hand in enterprises looking for other payment options.







Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, it looks like this temporary turmoil has not affected the experts’ stance on Visa’s prospects. The analyst consensus is strongly positive about Visa, with a Strong Buy rating based on 13 Unanimous Buys. The average Visa price target of $276.77 indicates an upside potential of 34.97%.

2734,Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Thursday.,2021-11-18
2735,"According to a report published by Reuters, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) plans to stop accepting credit cards issued by Visa, Inc. (V) in the U.K., starting next year, due to high transaction fees.



Meanwhile, Amazon customers in the U.K. can continue to use Visa debit cards, American Express (AXP) and Mastercard (MA) credit cards, and Eurocard.



Company Reaction



An Amazon spokesperson said, “As a result of Visa's continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept U.K.-issued Visa credit cards as of January 19, 2022.”



A Visa spokesperson said, “We are very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”



Market Reaction



Following Amazon’s announcement, the U.K. Trade Commission has called on the government to improve the trade agreement between the U.K. and the European Union (EU).



Furthermore, analysts have called on the U.K. regulators to look into credit card fees. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



During Brexit, the EU had imposed a cap on credit card fees charged by issuers. However, this cap is not in place in the U.K.



Tamara Cincik from the U.K. Trade and Business Commission, said, “If Amazon can't make it work, with all their resources and ability to navigate legislation to avoid costs, then small businesses have no chance and so the government must improve the U.K.-EU trade and cooperation agreement to keep British businesses competitive.”



Wall Street’s Take on Amazon



Recently, Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet maintained a Buy rating on Amazon but lowered the price target to $4,100 from $4,175 (15.5% upside potential) to reflect the third-quarter results.



However, Bazinet thinks there is a lot of scope for growth in the company’s business-to-business services.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon.com price target of $4,088.17 implies 15.2% upside potential. Shares have gained 14.3% over the past year.



Website Traffic of Amazon



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance.



According to the tool, the company’s website traffic registered a 30.64% decrease in global visits in October. Moreover, website traffic has declined 2.4% year-to-date.







Wall Street’s Take on Visa



On November 1, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev assigned a Buy rating to Visa and reduced the price target from $275 to $255 (24.4% upside potential).



Dolev said, “The expected dollar value of incentives in FY22 of ~$10bn is roughly in line with their normal trajectory had COVID not happened. In other words, while the % appears elevated, this is a reflection of management's low travel CXB volume assumptions, which we believe is very conservative given the pace of border reopening.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 unanimous Buys. The average Visa price target of $276.77 implies nearly 35% upside potential. Shares have lost 9.1% over the past six months.

2933,"As consumers make purchases, their transactions have to be processed by a protected and centralized entity. This is where Visa Inc. (V) comes in. The credit card company's business fundamentals are beginning to recover after a suppressing COVID-19 pandemic, and now-decelerating ecommerce trends. The company reported earnings this past week, and although it did beat on its past earnings, its guidance remained conservative.  (See Analyst's Top Stocks on TipRanks) 



Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities delivered a report on the large multinational, writing that the prevalence of credit usage is returning to its pre-pandemic levels, and could be boosted by a recovering travel industry as well. The question from him was, “Will the stock play along?” 



Dolev assigned a Buy rating on the stock, and calculated a price target of $275. This target suggests a potential 12-month upside of 27.44% from current levels.  



The four-star analyst asserted that the lower-than-expected guidance in the earnings print also translates to a possible easy beat in that metric, come Q4. For Dolev, strong Visa revenue performance hinges on a faster-than-expected recovery in the travel industry.  



Travel is currently forecasted to return to 2019 levels by the summer of 2023. This is due, in part, to the higher take rate derived from most travel expenses.  



Visa is currently experiencing “accelerating card penetration and a boost to US volume growth,” according to Dolev. Additionally, the company is seeing buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) payments, most of which is conducted via cards. However, there is a trend of processing volume moving toward using automatic clearing houses instead of Visa cards for some BNPL firms. This could spell risk for Visa, which has been benefitting from the alternative payment ecosystem.  



Taking a look at TipRanks’s website traffic data, total device visits to usa.visa.com declined quarter-over-quarter by 9.51%. Meanwhile, the share price fell 4.60% over that same period. When comparing the 2021 year-to-date period to the same one over 2020, visits to Visa’s website decreased 3.26%.
