3223,"Cloud-computing stocks have fallen back to Earth. There's still ample growth opportunity in the cloud names, but their high multiples have left them on the receiving end. A great number of beaten-up cloud players still have a front-row seat to one of the most lucrative markets out there; some of the plays may be oversold at this critical juncture. In this piece, we'll use TipRanks' Comparison Tool to compare and contrast three cloud stocks to see which, if any, have become cheap relative to their growth stories. Salesforce (CRM) Salesforce is a blue-chip cloud giant that's suffered such a massive blow, falling over 42% from peak to trough. Marc Benioff's empire was punished severely for its Slack acquisition before the worst of the tech-focused sell-off struck. Salesforce is a firm that's been known to conduct M&A to bolster its arsenal of leading software offerings. The company has gone from customer-relationship management (CRM) software top boss to a broader play on the digital transformation of work. Benioff has the talent to transform Salesforce into a FAANG-like play, as it makes most of its cloud tailwinds. In the meantime, it's nothing but negativity. Salesforce stock was a big-tech growth darling, but its 119 times trailing earnings multiple made it hard to love as rates rose. Further, the company may have lacked discipline when it came to big-league M&A. Many still doubt the Slack deal. Recently, Wedbush downgraded the stock's price target to $225 from $275. Though revenue growth could decelerate, the company's focus on margin expansion should be an effort that makes the lofty price-to-earnings multiple more digestible. My only knock against the company is that it doesn't have plans to get active on the M&A front now that tech valuations are down by so much. If anything, now is the time to double down on mid-cap tech firms on the CRM radar. Though some Wall Street analysts are lowering the bar, many continue to stand by their original price targets. I think they're right to do so. Analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the name, with the average Salesforce price target of $294.63, suggesting 59% upside potential from current levels. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft was one of few big tech companies that actually impressed this earnings season. With upbeat guidance alongside a better-than-expected result, I think Microsoft could singlehandedly help lift stocks out of their ruts. In the face of headwinds, Azure continued firing on all cylinders, with just shy of 50% in growth. Across other segments, Microsoft seemed to be faring incredibly well, and that's thanks to CEO Satya Nadella and company. Looking ahead, all eyes are on that Activision Blizzard (ATVI) acquisition. Warren Buffett seems to think that the deal will be given the green light. Though Microsoft is the second-largest company in America, it is noteworthy that Microsoft doesn't have a monopoly in the video game space. Should the deal get approval, I'd look for Microsoft to make some massive strides in gaming. In a prior piece, I noted that Microsoft could become as dominant a player in gaming as it is in the public cloud. For that reason, it's hard to ever doubt the stock, even if the rest of the market doesn't like it. It's not a mystery as to why Wall Street analysts still love the stock. Analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the name, with the average Microsoft price target of $360.81, suggesting 24.4% upside from current levels. Alphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet clocked in some pretty decent numbers this earnings season. While YouTube came up short, the 44% growth in Google Cloud was tough to ignore. Though Google needs to pick up its game to catch up to the big two in the public cloud, I do view the company's focus on uptime and reliability as a key to its growth moving forward. Whether or not Google Cloud can take share from AWS and Azure is another question entirely. For now, Alphabet has strength across the board, with a YouTube business that may be slowing due to temporary factors. The video platform has staying power, and is likely to only get stronger with time. For now, the economic reopening and more time spent on other platforms are headwinds that may prove temporary. The stock is among the cheapest of the FAANG group, with a mere 21.2 times trailing earnings multiple. Alphabet's latest quarter was far from perfect, but with three incredible pillars powering the stock, I think it's just a matter of time before the name rises under its own power again. Analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the name, with the average Alphabet price target of $3,270.47, suggesting 33.8% upside from current levels. Conclusion Cloud stocks have been pummelled of late. The following Strong Buy mega-cap players in the cloud space all seem like an intriguing value. At this juncture, Wall Street analysts seem most bullish on CRM stock.

7314,"Search engine titan and cloud computing giant Alphabet (GOOGL) continues to dominate in a variety of areas. 



However, one potentially major market may be about to elude it. Alphabet's Waymo arm has been working on developing a line of self-driving cars to serve as robotic taxis. 



It's not the only dog in that hunt, though, as the company is losing ground rapidly to a string of competitors. It's still worth being bullish on Alphabet, however, if you can afford the huge share price. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Looking at Alphabet's share prices over the last year so far shows the company has either climbed or plateaued. The early going in January was one such plateau, until a climb hit in late January into early February. 



A second plateau then kicked in until early April. After that, Alphabet embarked on a slow climb that featured only a few small downturns. Those were quickly wiped out.



The latest news, however, is a bit of a turnaround for Alphabet. Waymo's operations have been moving slowly for months. So slowly, in fact, that it's allowed competitors ranging from Ford (F) to General Motors (GM) to even Tesla (TSLA) to step into the race. 



Waymo's lead in the field has allowed it better access to investor funding, especially since Waymo has actually served as a robotic taxi service. Two cities so far have seen Waymo taxis, and are using them fairly often.



However, Waymo has been seen struggling to pull interest from what it most needs: an automaker. With a car manufacturer involved, Waymo will be much better able to ramp up its operations. Without a car manufacturer, the company will be limited in its scope and thus immediately hampered by any automaker who tries to roll out the self-driving taxi.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Alphabet has a Strong Buy consensus rating. That's based on 26 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Alphabet price target of $3,355.37 implies 13.7% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $2,965 per share to a high of $3,925 per share.







Drop in the Bucket



There's a reason Alphabet commands the high price per share that it does. It's not just that the company has seen incredible success in its various enterprises. That's just the icing on the cake. The point is that it has that many enterprises to work with to begin with. 



Its search engine, its advertising, its cloud computing systems, all of these and more contribute to Alphabet's expansive bottom line. Alphabet can carry on just fine without the robotic taxi market contributing.



Moreover, these competitors are some pretty serious. The field is drawing attention from legacy automakers. They have the ability to ramp up production at almost terrifying speeds. UBS recently declared Tesla the “undisputed leader” in the EV market. 



Granted, Tesla's been taking a beating recently. It was only $30 away from being in an official bear market on Monday, but it's making a comeback. It doesn't hurt that UBS hiked its price target from its original $725 to a new $1,000 per share mark.



Someone will likely beat Alphabet to the robotic taxi punch here. Unless Alphabet can set up a deal with a different carmaker, or start making its own cars, the production edge will always go to a company set up to make cars already. 



However, the robotic taxi market is comparatively small to begin with. If Alphabet loses out on a big slice of this market, it will still have a range of other operations to handily make up the slack.



Concluding Views



Alphabet's future in the robotic taxi market may not be great. It's still got a head start, at least for now. Alphabet will find itself hard-pressed to compete without an automaker to back its play, however. 



That likely won't hurt Alphabet much going forward. Even if it only becomes a niche player in the robotic taxi market, Alphabet will still have several other markets to dominate. 



Robotic taxi services may just be a mildly profitable side gig. That will disappoint investors who were hoping for more, but a lost opportunity is much different from actual losses. T



he sheer and staggering diversity of Alphabet is what matters most here.

7940,"The most popular series on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) of all-time has set another record passing one of the most popular television series of all-time.
What Happened: Streaming smash hit “Squid Game” set a record with 17 billion views for long and short form videos on YouTube, the video platform owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).
Variety reports using data from Vobile that “Squid Game” has passed the HBO show “Game of Thrones” with more views based on trailers, show clips, fan recreations and real-world challenges inspired by the plot.
The 17 billion views come from over 129,000 uploaded videos and have over 533 million engagements (likes, dislikes, comments).
Viewership could go up even more with top YouTube creator Mr. Beast working on recreating games from the show in real life.
A video from Mr. Beast featuring recreations of the games in “Minecraft” was viewed 32 million times.
“In ten years looking at YouTube, we’ve never seen anything quite like this,” Vice President of Audience Development at Vobile Jared Naylor told Variety.
“Game of Thrones,” which has a ten-year head start on “Squid Game,” has 16.9 billion views from over 420,000 uploaded videos.

Why It’s Important: Along with breaking the record for viewership on Netflix, “Squid Game” has turned into a pop culture phenomenon that has led to fan recreations, merchandise and Halloween costumes.
One of the factors for the record being set on YouTube could be attributed to its YouTube Shorts, a TikTok competitor.
The strong viewership of “Squid Game” on Netflix and YouTube validates the demand for the show and a sequel, which Netflix has confirmed it is in talks with the director to create.
“Game of Thrones” saw 233 million engagements from the uploaded videos, which is significantly lower than the total for “Squid Game” on a per video basis. A prequel to ""Game of Thrones"" is coming to AT&T Inc (NYSE: T) owned HBO in 2022. 
""Squid Game"" has shown that it has lasting power so far for Netflix and could continue to drive traffic and monetization opportunities for Netflix. An announcement of a sequel date in the future and the official release could be another huge pop culture event for Netflix and its stock. 
Price Action: NFLX shares were up 3.81% to $682.61 on Friday.
