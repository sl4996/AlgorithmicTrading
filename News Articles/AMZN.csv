4848,"Tech shares have taken a beating in 2022 as higher interest rates decreased the present value of future earnings growth. Investors are thinking twice before paying above-market multiples, and are focusing on value stocks instead.However a somewhat overlooked fact is that technology companies often have a very conservative capital structure. Most big technology companies, such as Apple (AAPL), are sitting on a net cash position. This is in contrast to utility and real estate companies, which often use leverage to juice up returns.Avenues to Deploy Excess CapitalThere are several different ways companies can deploy this excess cash. First, they can invest it in their core businesses and grow organically. Second, they can use it for acquisitions. Third, they can return it to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Lastly, they can keep their options open, and keep the dry powder on their books. The last option allows companies to exploit periods of market turmoil to boost returns. This is what Warren Buffet does at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). Berkshire ended Q1 2022 with around $103 billion in cash, down from $144 billion at the end of Q4 2021. In essence, Berkshire deemed the opportunities in Q1 2022 worth deploying some 28% of its cash pile.It is likely that dropping share prices will prompt corporate treasurers to deploy the excess cash reserves accumulated in the good days. Nevertheless, as we have seen at Berkshire, some of the cash will remain on the books.In this article I will explore what effects rising rates will have on corporate profits for some of the tech companies sitting on the largest cash pile.AppleAt the end of Q1 2022 -- which for Apple is Q2 given the September financial year -- the interest-sensitive portions of Apple's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$28.1Marketable securities$164.6Commercial Paper$7Term debt$113Total$192.7$120Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureIn total, Apple is sitting on a net cash position of about $72.7 billion, which could fetch an extra $2 billion a year in pre-tax profits if reinvested at the 3% Fed funds rate currently expected by the market over the medium term.The impact from the extra income largely depends on Apple's product cycle. I think the effect will be more noticeable in years without major product releases. Overall though the impact should be a boost to earnings by 2-3%.Alphabet (GOOGL)At the end of Q1 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Google's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$20.9Marketable securities$113Long-term debt$14.8Total$133.9$14.8Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureOverall, Google has at its disposal some $119.1 billion net for reinvestments, which could boost pre-tax income by some $3.3 billion over the medium term. Given the more conservative balance sheet of Google as compared to Apple, the boost to earnings should be around 4%.Meta Platforms (FB)At the end of Q1 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Facebook's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$14.9Marketable securities$29Total$43.9Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureCuriously, Facebook has no debts. As the company moves into a more mature phase, this may prompt the corporate treasurer to diversify the capital structure. This should allow debt investors to have an allocation towards Facebook, and at the same time potentially lower the cost of capital. As things stand, the net cash position of around $43.9 billion should bring an extra $1.2 billion in pre-tax income over the medium term. The overall boost to pre-tax income should be around 3%.Amazon (AMZN)At the end of Q1 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Amazon's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$36.4Marketable securities$30Long-term debt$47.5Total$66.4$47.5Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureAmazon recorded a sharp drop in marketable securities in Q1 2022 to $30 billion, down from $59.8 billion in Q4 2021. This was partly the result of a $8.2 billion valuation loss, of which $7.6 billion was due to a writedown in the value of Rivian (RIVN). As of the end of Q1 2022, Amazon held a circa 18% stake in the electric car maker. Overall, the benefit to pre-tax profit from the reinvestment of the spare cash would be in the 1%-2% range.Microsoft (MSFT)At the end of Q1 2022 -- which for Microsoft is Q3 given the June financial year -- the interest-sensitive portions of Microsoft's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$12.5Short-term investments$92.2Long-term debt$50Total$104.7$50Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureThe reinvestment of the net cash position of Microsoft at circa $54.7 billion would results in a pre-tax earnings boots of close to 2%.Intel (INTC)At the end of Q1 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Intel's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$6.2Short-term investments$32.5Debt$37.25Total$38.7$37.25Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureDespite boasting a large absolute cash pile, Intel's actual net cash position is negligible when the debt is taken into account.Tesla (TSLA)At the end of Q1 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Tesla's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$17.5Short-term investments$0.5Debt and finance leases$4.8Total$18$4.8Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on Q1 2022 disclosureAutomakers have traditionally relied on having a sizable cash pile to ride out industry downturns. Tesla's $13.2-billion net cash position could boost pre-tax profits by $350 million, or 5%-6%, which is quite significant in percentage terms. In absolute terms, however, given the market capitalization of the company, the effect would be negligible.Nvidia (NVDA)At the end of January 2022, the interest-sensitive portions of Nvidia's balance sheet were as follows:Balance sheet item, USD billionAssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents$2Short-term investments$19.2Long-term debt$10.9Total$21.2$10.9Selected Balance Sheet Items, Author's calculations based on January 2022 Annual reportNvidia boasts a net cash position of around $10.3 billion. A reinvestment at the expected 3% Fed funds rate could boost pre-tax returns by $275 million, or close to 3%.SummaryWhen it comes to the cash pile of tech companies, the devil is in the details. Overall, the group will be a net beneficiary of higher rates. Older tech companies, such as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple, have a more diversified capital structure, and a sizable debt component. Over the short term, Tesla looks like the biggest winner of higher rates. However, this is the result of a small pre-tax profit relative to the net cash position. I expect the effect to diminish as car production increases in the future, boosting pre-tax profits. Over the medium term, Google parent Alphabet should be the biggest beneficiary of higher rates, given its meaningful $119.1 billion net cash and cash equivalents position.All in all, while higher rates will by no means be a main driver for tech earnings, most names should experience an earnings per share bump of several percentage points. The effect may end up being slightly larger over the very short term. This is due to the fact that the debt companies have issued is usually with a fixed interest rate. Eventually, these bonds will have to be refinanced at higher rates. In the meantime, however, their immediate cash reserves can be redeployed very quickly at the higher Fed funds rate. Of course, this is offset by the fact that companies themselves have invested a portion of their marketable securities into longer-duration instruments. At the end of the day, there is still a silver lining for tech shares when higher rates are concerned.Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure",2022-05-03

5817,"Leon’s Furniture (TSE: LNF) is a Canadian success story. Founded in 1909 by Lebanese immigrant Ablan Leon, the company went public in 1969. Most shares of the furniture retailer remain held by the Leon family today. Leon’s has spread its way from Southwestern Ontario to all 10 Canadian provinces, helped along by a C$700-million acquisition of rival firm The Brick in 2012. Along with integrating The Brick, Leon’s has undergone a digital transformation of sorts over the past decade, investing heavily in e-commerce and even an augmented reality shopping experience. Nevertheless, while brick-and-mortar retailers have been under pressure in recent years from the rise of e-commerce, there remain certain advantages to in-person shopping, especially regarding furniture. Getting to see the exact product you’re buying, along with its exact measurements, can give shoppers more security when purchasing expensive living room sets, for example. This benefits Leon’s, which has a vast array of physical locations. With Canada undergoing a real estate surge, logic also dictates that many would-be home buyers might prefer to renovate and revamp their current living spaces. While Leon’s impressive balance sheet and hefty income prospects are promising factors, increasing competition in a tricky industry are issues weighing on the stock, which has sunk by around 13% year-to-date. Weighing that all into consideration, I am bullish on Leon’s. Strong Management Management handled its acquisition of The Brick well, making Leon’s the largest furniture, appliance, and electronics retailer in Canada. Of the 306 retail locations across Canada owned by Leon’s, about two-thirds of them are under The Brick branding, especially in Western Canada.  Since most of the company’s shares are owned by the Leon family, management knows the industry very well, and it is likely to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Leon’s released its Fiscal 2021 earnings at the end of February, with a record C$3.1 billion in system-wide sales, a year-over-year increase of 13.2%.  Other highlights for the year were a 27.5% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to C$2.60 and a 26.9% increase in net income to C$205.5 million. Competition Of the C$11.6 billion dollars spent on furniture in Canada in 2020, Leon’s took in $2.2 billion, a market share of about 18% in a very competitive space. This is a slight drop from the 19% it earned in 2019, with Canadians spending C$11.85 billion on furniture that year. Leon’s has to compete with massive online and brick-and-mortar retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) while holding off smaller boutique options or specialty stores like Sleep Country Canada (TSE: ZZZ). Dividend Leon’s pays a quarterly dividend of C$0.16 per share, for a 3.1% forward dividend yield. When including the special dividend that was paid out last year, its dividend yielded near 9%. That is above the sector average in Consumer Goods of 1.5% by quite a bit. The payout ratio of 72.5% is certainly elevated, though the company did report C$486.6 million in cash and investments on hand at the end of Fiscal Year 2021.  Given that Leon’s only spent C$210.6 million on dividends and buybacks through all of FY 2021, the current dividend should be safe going forward. Insider Activity Those within the company have enough reason to be optimistic regarding Leon’s fortunes, to the tune of spending C$147,300 on shares over the past three months. We’re able to track insider buying and selling thanks to TipRanks’ Insider Trading tool, which shows us that the most recent selling action by an insider was done by Terrence Thomas Leon, the company's vice chairman, all the way back in November. However, that same insider bought C$42,500 worth of shares in March. While it would never be prudent to invest based solely on one indicator, the fact that insiders are almost entirely buying into the company is generally a good sign. Wall Street’s Take Leon’s stock doesn’t have much of an analyst following. The company has a Hold rating consensus on TipRanks, due to one Hold rating assigned. That Hold rating – delivered by near-five-star analyst Stephen Macleod of BMO – does have a price target of C$28, which suggests 34.9% upside potential. Conclusion Vouching for a legacy brick-and-mortar retailer isn’t easy these days, but Leon’s has enough going for it that it’s worth looking into, especially given the stock’s performance over the last few months. Management is “cautiously optimistic” going into FY 2022 due to uncertainties surrounding the Canadian economy, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt supply chains and purchasing behavior. It also remains to be seen how successful the company’s investments in modernizing its customers’ experiences will be over the long term. One investment, which uses augmented reality to allow shoppers to use their phones to “place” a piece of furniture in a room inside their homes, made its debut in the latter half of 2019. This likely isn’t a stock that’s going to explode in value any time soon, but there are reasons to believe it belongs inside the portfolio of a patient, long-term investor.

5983,"I am bullish when it comes to Netflix (NFLX) stock since it has dropped considerably since the start of the year. There has been a significant dip in most areas of the economy recently. However, given the current correction in the market, there are innumerable tech companies that offer great upside, one of them being Netflix. Netflix has revolutionized the way we watch TV shows and movies by offering a wide variety of content that you can watch at any time -- there is no need to wait for the next episode or movie to come out. Netflix has achieved success by focusing on its brand image, and customer experience. The company has accomplished this by using a combination of personalization, and AI technology. Netflix uses AI to ensure that its users get the best experience possible. For example, Netflix uses machine learning algorithms to predict what type of content you will most likely be interested in watching next. While in the past, Netflix was the only streaming service that many people used, companies like Walt Disney (DIS), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) have provided a lot of great competition in recent years. However, Netflix has managed to hold on to its crown so far. Plus, the company's annual revenue in 2021 is around $30 billion. Netflix is growing like never before and shows no signs of stopping. Rate Hike More people are signing up for subscriptions every day, so it's natural for the companies that provide this service to be raising rates. Netflix is no different. The standard plan will cost $15.49 a month, while the basic subscription will stay at $9.99. The premium plan will go up by $2 per month to match the increase in consumer demand. One of the main aspects investors will be looking at is Netflix's price point. Over the years, Netflix has prided itself on providing quality entertainment at an attractive price. However, Netflix will be spending more on content in the coming years. It's estimated that it will pay $17 billion in 2022, increasing 57% from what it spent in 2020. Hence, while it's still understandable that the company is hiking prices to keep up with consumer demand, the one aspect you cannot ignore is that its content budget is rising with each passing year. To fund content, Netflix will have to implement some models that increase the cost of its service. The entertainment company can achieve this through occasional price increases or introducing a new password lock for its streaming service. The streaming giant has not indicated that it is looking into adding an ad tier, which can become a new revenue stream. Therefore, consumers can expect more price increases in the future. What Options Does Netflix Have? Netflix has probably seen its best days in the United States and Canada (UCAN) region. That territory is saturated, and you cannot expect more growth from this region. Latin America and the Asia Pacific are expected to lead growth in the coming years. Europe and MEA will be a bit smaller, but will still likely remain very prevalent in the next few years. Netflix is continuously looking for places to base its future growth. Since these regions have the largest populations, this decision will affect them. However, the company will have to sacrifice margins in these areas. In India, Netflix starts at $2.60 for all devices or $2 if you only use mobile. The per capita income in India is $1,947.417 versus $68,309 for the U.S. in 2021. It remains to be seen how patient the average Netflix investor will stay with this strategy. Investors should ensure that Netflix is still in a good position since it consistently converts revenues into operating income. By 2021, the company had an unfavorable $159 million in FCF. Netflix has been investing heavily in content and increasing its service. Therefore, it will take time for the company to grow free cash flow sustainably. That is something investors will have to live with. The positive angle to show this development is that the company with the best content will dominate streaming. So far, Netflix's ratings are higher than all other streaming apps. Wall Street's Take Netflix's stock has performed better than many other companies in the last three months. Thirty-five Wall Street analysts have come up with 12-month price targets: 18 are Buys, 15 are Holds, and two are Sells. The average Netflix price target is $510.89, implying 45.3% upside. Bottom Line on Netflix Netflix has revolutionized how we watch TV shows and movies. By providing a wide variety of content from all genres, Netflix has become the go-to place for binge-watching. Netflix is also one of the most successful companies globally, with almost $30 billion in annual revenue and over 222 million subscribers worldwide. With such success, it's no surprise that Netflix has been on everyone's lips as an investment opportunity.

6032,"Shares of Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) have recently reached its multi-year lows, losing half of its market capitalization over the last year. This is despite the fact that “Shopify nearly tripled revenue, more than doubled GMV and the Shopify team, and the number of merchants using Shopify is nearly twice as big as 2019 levels,” as highlighted by Shopify President Harley Finkelstein during the earnings call on Feb 16. There are a host of factors that could be pulling the stock down: the end of its “hyper-growth” phase during the pandemic years on resumption of physical stores; outlook below expectations; absence of government stimulus; growing inflation putting pressure on consumers' budget; and macro and geo-political risks. Investors are very much concerned about the slowdown in hyper growth seen during the pandemic years visible in the company’s outlook. The company expected slower revenue growth in the first half of the year. To boost its revenues, Shopify is now focused on international expansion and the creation of an integrated e-commerce model that focuses on logistics and warehouses, spending a significant amount on a network of fulfilment centers. Notably, the company plans to reinvest its profits and will incur a capital expenditure of $200 million in 2022, with an incremental $1 billion expected in the next two years. The big question is: are investors’ looking forward to the real, long-term growth embedded in Shopify, or are they only focussing on the slowdown in growth and margin compression due to increased CAPEX? Let us take a deeper look at the stock. The Roadmap Ahead In terms of gross merchandise volume (GMV), Shopify was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic as world consumption moved online. In 2020, Shopify’s GMV jumped a whopping 96% to $120 billion, followed by another 47% increase in 2021. In fact, GMV almost tripled from $61 billion in 2019 to $175 billion in FY21. Notably, in FY2021, Shopify maintained its second position in terms of e-commerce sales with a 10.3% market share in the U.S., right after Amazon (AMZN) at 41% and ahead of Walmart (WMT) at 6%. However, there is a huge gap between Amazon and Shopify’s market share, leaving ample room for Shopify to capture the same as it continues to expand its merchant base and help merchants consolidate their vendors. In fact, the company’s revenue growth in Q4 was still higher than the pre-COVID levels, on a two-year stack basis. Last week, Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Cantwell initiated coverage on Shopify with a Buy rating and a price target of $834 (38.27% upside potential). Cantwell believes that the company deserves to trade at premium valuation to its peers within the Fintech space given “SHOP’s positioning as a unique disruptor, its strong growth profile, and its attractive opportunity globally”. Cantwell highlights that Shopify has a substantial scope for growth with over $160 billion total marketable opportunity (TAM) in revenue and global retail volume worth $25 trillion. The analyst foresees increased adoption of balance, capital, fulfillment, markets, and physical POS that would further “drive expansion in Shopify’s merchant base, improved MRR and take rate metrics, and naturally, growth in Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions revenue.” Cantwell stated that “shares have historically traded as high as 47x EV/Sales, but have declined recently on broader sector risk-off. We believe as macro conditions stabilize and SHOP’s strong, above-peer financial performance manifests, this will drive multiple expansion and share price appreciation.” On TipRanks, Shopify stock commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and 13 Holds. As for price targets, the average Shopify stock price forecast of $982.44 implies almost 62.85% upside potential from the current level. Key Takeaway Shopify has a stalwart position in the e-commerce space and should benefit from the tailwinds of rising e-commerce penetration and digital commerce transformation with its impressive platform of products and services, earning it the second position after Amazon. Fintechs like Shopify are focusing on vendor consolidation to further expand its merchant base. The company’s capital expenditure and international expansion plans are moves in the right direction with the aim of gaining substantial market share in the years to come. Investors may consider the long-term story and make the most of the current price levels, which look extremely attractive at current valuations. Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.

6994,"It seems retail consumers are undeterred by the rising inflation as indicated by retail sales in February. According to a press release from the U.S. Census Bureau, the advance estimates for retail and food service sales in the U.S. for the month of February showed an increase of 0.3% from January - a slowing monthly pace. However, on a year-over-year basis, sales in February rose 17.6%. This prompted National Retail Federation (NRF) President and CEO Matthew Shay to comment, “Despite all that’s been thrown at them including inflation, supply chain constraints, market volatility, and significant geopolitical events, consumers remain able and willing to spend.” Indeed, the NRF anticipates retail sales this year to grow in the range between 6% and 8%. With retail sales expected to grow amid inflation, should investors consider retail sector stocks? Yes, seems to be the answer from Wall Street analysts. Using the TipRanks database, we looked at some top-rated analysts’ stocks in the consumer goods sector, and specifically retail. For the purpose of this article, we have ignored the giants of the retail sector like Amazon (AMZN) and picked smaller stocks that offer significant upside potential and carry with them heavy bullish sentiments. Here are the top three picks. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) New York-based Tapestry, Inc. is a house of luxury accessories and lifestyle brands including Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Shares of Tapestry have dropped 8% year-to-date. However, for Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, the stock remains a “top pick at a bargain.” Late in February, the analyst came away bullish on the stock following a meeting with the company’s management. His key takeaway was that the momentum in Tapestry’s business continues to remain strong, despite macroeconomic headwinds. Elaborating further, Boruchow pointed out that the outlook for TPR’s handbag category is “favourable” as “management expects growth in the category to return to the historic +MSD [mid single digit] to +HSD [high single digit] rate as COVID headwinds subside.” Another positive for the stock is that the company’s enhanced data and analytics capabilities are leading to higher average unit retail (AURs), “increased full price selling [and] improving inventory turns.” Boruchow is also upbeat about TPR’s digital business which saw revenues grow 30% year-over-year in Q2 of FY22. The analyst believes that rising digital penetration will create a “long-term margin tailwind that we believe is underappreciated by investors.” Moreover, according to the analyst, Tapestry has a competitive advantage in China with its Coach brand that has existed in the country for decades. Coach has an “extremely high brand awareness” and is at an affordable price point in China, giving it access to a growing and massive middle class addressable market. Boruchow assigned a price target of $58 on the stock, implying an upside potential of 54.4% to pre-market trading levels on Thursday. Other analysts on the Street echo Boruchow, with a consensus rating of Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and two Holds. The average TPR price forecast of $56.17 implies approximately 49.5% upside potential to pre-market trading levels on Thursday. Kontoor Brands (NYSE: KTB) Kontoor Brands, Inc. is a lifestyle apparel company that has a portfolio which includes the iconic consumer brands, Wrangler and Lee. While shares of KTB have tanked 16% year-to-date, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul sees four potential growth catalysts for the stock, as outlined by the company’s management. Kontoor is focusing on enhancing its core wholesale business in the U.S. and expects this business to grow in high single-digit to low double-digit percentages in 2021, followed by low single-digit percentage growth in FY22 and FY23. Moreover, KTB is also focused on extending its retail categories to outdoor, tees, and work apparel. Drbul expects the growth from “the outdoor, work, and T-shirt categories to amass over $200 million in revenue for KTB over the next 3 years.” China is proving to be an important market for KTB, and the company is focused on expanding its business in that space. The analyst expects KTB’s Chinese market to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next three years, and comprise 10% of the company’s sales in 2023. Drbul also anticipates that the digital business will increase at a “ ~40% CAGR over the next 3 years.” The analyst is positive about KTB’s $1 billion of cumulative cash from operations, and believes that it gives the company “significant optionality as it relates to capital allocation.” As a result, Drbul has rated the stock a Buy and set a price target of $75, indicating an upside potential of 72.6% to early morning trading levels on Thursday. Other analysts on the Street are also upbeat about the stock, with a consensus rating of Strong Buy based on four Buys and one Hold. The average KTB price forecast of $63.20 implies approximately 45.5% upside potential to early morning trading levels on Thursday. Turtle Beach Corp. (NASDAQ: HEAR) Turtle Beach is a gaming accessory provider, and its products include keyboards, mice, headsets, mousepads, and other PC accessories. On March 22, the company gave a mid-quarter update and stated that it delivered an EBITDA margin of 10% in a “challenging year” and remains on track to deliver around $100 million in non-console headsets revenue this year. HEAR added that over the past five years, the company has delivered five-year total shareholder returns of more than 350%. The company also released a statement regarding the Donerail Group and the SCW Capital Management’s efforts to take control of the company. Donerail intends to nominate six candidates to stand for election to the company’s Board of Directors. Turtle Beach stated in its press release that this attempt by Donerail to gain control of the company is an attempt to achieve its objective “without paying a control premium to all Turtle Beach shareholders.” As a result, HEAR’s Board is “not supportive of Donerail’s attempt to take control of the Company after failing to provide adequate proof of financing with respect to its prior proposals to acquire the Company.” These takeover rumblings have also led to an erosion in the company’s stock price, which has dropped 12.8% year-to-date. While Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter is sidelined on the stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $24, the analyst remains “positive on Turtle Beach long-term” as it has “repeatedly proved that it can maintain or build market share in various environments.” The analyst’s Hold rating on the stock stems from the fact that Pachter thinks that the stock has “limited upside over the next two quarters based on various headwinds” which is likely to drag down the stock price over the near term. However, Turtle Beach has a consensus rating of a Strong Buy from other analysts on the Street based on five Buys and one Hold. The average HEAR price forecast of $30.83 implies approximately 52.6% upside potential to early morning trading levels on Thursday. Bottom Line Except for Turtle Beach, the other two stocks seem to be targeting or expanding into new markets, like China, and are also focusing on their digital channels. For Turtle Beach, the company seems to be progressing well when it comes to its gaming accessories business. Download the TipRanks mobile app now.

7636,"Even after a sustained period of share losses, Amazon (AMZN) stock is still pricey, with one share going for $2,936.35. That, however, is about to come an end. On Wednesday, the tech giant announced it would enact a 20-for-1 stock split, which will go into effect on June 6, should the move be given the go ahead by shareholders in May. If that wasn’t enough to satisfy investors, the company also said it rebought $800 million of shares under its old repurchase authorization and has given the green light for a $10 billion repurchase plan. These are rare actions for Amazon. The last stock split took place in 1999, while prior to the $1.3 billion purchase made in January, it had been 10 years – 1Q2012, in fact - since the company forked out on common stock. If past purchases are anything to go by, then investors could be in for a good time over the next couple of years. “Historically AMZN's repurchases have been positive signals about the equity value,” says Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak, “as they would have earned an average return of 42% over a 6 month return period.” Likewise, assuming an investor bought and held the stock, over a 12-and 24-month period, Amazon's share repurchases would have generated returns of 100% and 135%, respectively. While the moves are “more symbolic than material,” all these actions indicate to Nowak that the company is becoming “increasingly shareholder friendly,” and this in turn can help “catalyze potential multiple expansion.” Evidently, investors liked the announcement, sending shares ~5% higher in Thursday's trading session. Amazon joins other tech luminaires with its latest shareholder pleasing moves, a development Nowak applauds. “As bigtech (GOOGL/FB/AAPL/MSFT) becomes more shareholder friendly (buybacks, disclosure, etc) we are happy to see AMZN participate, allowing it to better compete for investor capital,” the analyst summed up. Accordingly, Nowak reiterated an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on Amazon shares along with a $4,200 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 43%. (To watch Nowak’s track record, click here) There are no Wall Street analysts betting against Amazon’s continued success; all 34 reviews on record are positive, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. The average price target of $4,218 and change is practically the same as Nowak’s.

For an e-commerce firm like Amazon, total website visits are a strong measure of user engagement on Amazon's platform. The company's main website, amazon.com, focuses on buying and selling goods. As a result, more user engagement suggests increased demand for the company's products and services available on its website, implying higher revenues.



Amazon also offers digital streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video and Twitch platforms. So, higher monthly users on these platforms imply higher subscription revenues earned by the company.



Therefore, we used TipRanks' new website visit tracking tool to learn more about Amazon's performance ahead of Q4.



The graph below illustrates that total projected visits to Amazon's core platform, amazon.com, decreased marginally throughout the quarter. More precisely, we see that total visits to amazon.com decreased by 0.57% sequentially to 9.4 billion.







Also, on a year-over-year basis, Amazon's total estimated visits are down 27.35% in Q4 2021 compared to Q4 2020. The declining trend in monthly users suggests that Amazon's e-commerce revenues may have been lackluster in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.







Website Stats for Amazon’s Other Domains



In addition, the tool reveals that user visits to Amazon's video streaming sites, such as Amazon Prime Video and Twitch, decreased sequentially in Q4. Notably, the total estimated visits to prime.video.com and twitch.tv declined by 9.69% and 22% sequentially, respectively in Q4.



This quarterly drop indicates that subscriber growth may slow in the fourth quarter.  Increasing competition in the streaming space or lack of new content could have led to a decline in website visits this quarter.



On the contrary, the website traffic figures for its subsidiary Whole Foods Market, a natural foods store chain, appear to be fairly encouraging. The total estimated visits to wholefoodsmarket.com climbed by 22.7% sequentially to 30.7 million in Q4. The growth has most likely resulted in higher retail revenues for the firm in the quarter under review.



Experts’ Take



Ahead of Amazon’s upcoming earnings release, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter maintained a Buy rating on Amazon and a price target of $3,950 per share.



According to Pachter, macroeconomic issues such as ""supply chain bottlenecks"" and ""full U.S. employment"" will have a negative impact on Amazon's financial performance in Q4. Therefore, he expects operating income and revenue to achieve the low end of the range of guidance. 



Amazon also has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street analysts, with 22 unanimous Buys. The Amazon stock projections indicate an average price target of $4,192.86, suggesting a possible 12-month upside of 40.2%.

9785,"Next week will see Amazon (AMZN) step up to the earnings plate. The company will deliver 4Q21’s financials on February 3 (Thursday, AMC) and investors will be hoping the performance will enable the stock to perform a turnaround. So far, shares have retreated by 15% in January’s market wide carnage.



Don’t get your hopes too high, though, appears to be the message from Wedbush’s Michael Pachter. The analyst expects “gloomy year-end results driven by macroeconomic factors.” He attributes his bearish outlook to the ""ongoing supply chain crisis and full U.S. employment,"" which ""likely limited Amazon’s fulfillment capabilities during the holiday quarter.”



Several years of costly investments, to assert more control over the shipping trajectory of its products, have helped Amazon mitigate some supply chain issues. Yet, Pachter notes that according to SJ Consulting Group, around 30% of its own packages are still reliant on delivery partners. “This means that industry-wide shortages in shipping containers, truck drivers, and readily available ports likely impacted delivery times and caused strain for many orders as shipping containers surged from under $2,000 before the pandemic to over $20,000 with multi-week delays,” Pachter explained.  



Moreover, due to customers hoping to avoid future delays, supply chain issues were probably further exacerbated by “elevated” shopping levels for products already in high demand, such as semiconductors.



On top of these headwinds, Pachter thinks that during the quarter, Amazon was also likely negatively impacted by the U.S. labor market, which fell to a 3.9% unemployment rate in December. Accordingly, Pachter thinks Amazon was probably hit by “accelerating wage growth as well as a higher mix of shorter-term workers amid a lax job environment.”



It all implies Amazon will likely put a lid on expectations for the foreseeable future.



“The combination of a national unemployment rate that is expected to continue dwindling until year-end and an ongoing supply chain fiasco leads us to believe that management will be conservative when guiding investors on a top-line and profitability basis,” the analyst added. 



Not everything is doom and gloom, however. Pachter believes that Amazon is well-placed for strong growth over the long term, noting: ""We see significant long-term growth opportunity as management continues to build out its cloud arm and marketplace capabilities to more consumers, and advertisers, worldwide.""



All in all, Pachter rates AMZN shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $3,950 price target. This figure suggests shares will climb 40% over the next 12 months. (To watch Pachter’s track record, click here)



Ongoing headwinds or not, there are currently 30 AMZN reviews from Wall Street analysts and all are positive, making for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The outlook calls for one-year gains of ~47%, considering the average target currently stands at $4,135 and change. (See Amazon stock forecast on TipRanks)

10505,"Amazon (AMZN) is one of the top five companies in the United States that is working in the information technology industry. The company focuses on e-commerce, AI, digital streaming, and cloud computing. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company was founded in 1994, and since then, its team has grown marginally. 



In 2020, the multinational company had 1,298,000 employees working in either full-time or part-time capacity. In the same year, Amazon also reported total net revenue of $386 billion. Its offices are located in 36 different countries, with the total number of locations reaching 235.



I am bullish on Amazon as it has strong growth potential, a wide moat, a discounted valuation, unanimous Wall Street bullishness, and substantial upside relative to its one-year price target.



Strengths



Amazon has tapped into three different but equally vast industries, including retail, internet, and consumer electronics industries. It has a significant global footprint, with Amazon Marketplace serving 17 countries in total. 



Between 2018 and 2019, the company saw a massive increase in its revenues and profits, a 20.5% and 15% increase, respectively. Its low price structures, significant number of third-party sellers, and the largest merchandise selection have earned it the rightful place in the market. 



It has created unrivaled synergies between four different marketplaces through the various businesses it runs, including Marketplace, Prime, Web Services, and Subscription services. The technological advancements have allowed the company to cope with larger capacities and enhance customer satisfaction at a fraction of the costs.



Recent Results



Amazon’s net sales reached $386 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2019, the net sales were at $280.5 billion, which means the total year-over-year growth percentage for 2020 was approximately 38%. 



Net income increased from $11.59 billion in 2019 to $21.33 billion in 2020. Additionally, the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year also increased from $36.1 billion to $42.27 billion in 2020.



The basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share reached $42.64 and $41.83, respectively. The year before that, these numbers stood at $23.46 and $23.01, respectively



Valuation Metrics



AMZN stock looks attractively valued at the moment. It currently trades at a 22.3x forward enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio, which looks quite reasonable compared to its historical average of 23.1x. Furthermore, its forward price-to-normalized-earnings ratio of 83.3x is well below its historical average of 100.5x. 



Meanwhile, growth is expected to be strong in the coming years, with EBITDA expected to grow by 23% in 2022 and normalized earnings-per-share expected to grow by 28.9% in 2022.



Wall Street’s Take



According to Wall Street analysts, AMZN earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buy ratings and no Hold or Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. Additionally, the average Amazon price target of $4,137.5 puts the upside potential at 31.7%.







Summary and Conclusions



Amazon is a leader across many industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It has a wide moat with a vaunted logistics infrastructure underpinning its dominant online presence. Given that it operates in innovative and disruptive industries, it has a lengthy growth runway that makes its current valuation multiples look very reasonable.



On top of that, Wall Street is unanimously bullish on the stock, and the average price target implies substantial upside for the share price over the next year. As a result, it looks like it might be a good time to add shares.

10523,"Big tech stocks have witnessed a fair amount of selling over the past month. Valuation concerns and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic led to a selloff in tech stocks. The chart below shows that big tech companies are trading in the red, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platform (NASDAQ:FB) barely managed to stay in the green over the past month. 







With tech stocks currently under pressure, let’s look at each of these tech giants to ascertain what the future holds for them in 2022.



Apple 



Despite supply-chain concerns, Apple delivered a solid financial performance in FY21. Strong sales across all product categories and strength across all of its geographies drove Apple’s financials, and in turn, its stock, which outperformed the benchmark index in 2021. 



Looking ahead, demand for Apple products is likely to outpace supply, as noted by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst is bullish on Apple stock. He sees higher demand and the easing of supply-chain issues in the first half of 2022 as a tailwind for Apple stock. Moreover, Ives noted that higher average selling prices provide a multi-year growth opportunity. 



Besides robust demand and higher selling prices, Ives expects Apple to gain from its growing market share in China. 



Overall, the majority of analysts are bullish on Apple stock. Its Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, hedge funds have been selling Apple stock. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have sold 4 million Apple shares over the past three months. 



Amazon 



Tough comparisons, cost inflation, and supply-chain disruptions weighed on Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) financial performance in 2021, and in turn, its stock price. Amazon stock underperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index by a wide margin in 2021. 



Given the near-term challenges, investors and hedge funds have a negative outlook on Amazon stock. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that about 1.3% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold AMZN stock in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, hedge funds have lowered their holdings by 576.2K shares in three months. 



Nevertheless, Monness analyst Brian White is bullish on Amazon for 2022. He expects Amazon’s growth to accelerate in the 2H22. Further, White noted that AWS’ (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, while Amazon is well-positioned to benefit from an “accelerated digital transformation.” 



Along with White, most Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Amazon stock. AMZN has received 30 positive analyst reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. 



Alphabet



Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock delivered strong returns in 2021 and outperformed its peers, thanks to the stellar recovery in ad sales and the strength of its cloud business. 



Looking ahead, Alphabet could benefit from higher advertising revenues and growth in the cloud segment. Further, its balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. 



Taking note of its strong cash flows, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial stated that Alphabet would continue to boost shareholders’ returns through share buybacks and fund its growth initiatives on the back of its robust cash flows. 



Feinseth sees Alphabet benefiting from secular tech trends, including video sharing, cloud computing, growing mobile engagement, and the ongoing shift to digital advertising, among others. 



On TipRanks, Alphabet stock sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buy and 2 Hold recommendations. Furthermore, 1.9% of the investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have increased their exposure to GOOGL stock over the last 30 days. 



Microsoft 



Thanks to the strength in its cloud business, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock increased over 49% in one year and outperformed the benchmark index. Despite the appreciation in its share price, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is upbeat about Microsoft’s prospects and maintains a bullish outlook on the stock. Thill increased his price target on Microsoft to $400 from $375. 



Thill sees Microsoft as the “safest largecap investment option” with multiple growth vectors. The analyst expects Microsoft to continue to enhance shareholder value on the back of its strong profitability and free cash flows. However, he expects Microsoft’s top-line growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters. 



Overall, on TipRanks, Microsoft stock has received 24 Buys and 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Furthermore, it scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score system, indicating that MSFT stock could outperform the market averages.



Meta Platforms 



Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to better reflect a metaverse company. However, investors and hedge funds continue to dump their stock. 



TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that about 0.7% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold FB stock in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have sold 1.7 million Meta Platforms shares over the past three months. 



Monness analyst Brian White noted, “The longer-term journey for Facebook became more intriguing in the later part of 2021 with the company introducing its vision for the metaverse, followed by a name change to Meta Platforms.” 



However, he expects Apple’s app tracking transparency to continue to hurt Meta Platforms in the future. 



Nevertheless, he maintains a Buy rating on Meta Platforms and expects it to benefit from favorable digital ad trends and digital transformation opportunities. Meanwhile, on TipRanks, FB stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys and 5 Holds.

Insiders are investors who have a more than 10% stake in the company and are a principal stakeholder, an officer or a director. According to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, insiders must file forms every time they buy or sell shares.



However, to prevent insiders from trading shares using non-public information to which they have access, the SEC prohibits insiders from disposing of shares within six months of purchasing them.



Let us analyze some of these insider transactions by company CEOs and the possible reasons behind this sell-off.



Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and considered the richest person in the world, has been on a stock selling spree. In November, the CEO took a poll on Twitter (TWTR) asking people whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares to pay taxes.



When a majority of Twitter users voted yes, Musk began offloading his stock. On December 29, the CEO stated in an interview to the Babylon Bee, as  cited by CNBC, “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here.”



Musk sold another 934,090 shares on December 29, at a worth of $1.02 billion, taking the total shares sold in 2021 to a value of $10.6 billion. What’s more, Musk also exercised options to buy around 1.6 million shares at an exercise price of $6.24 per share. This is the first time that Musk has sold his shares since 2016, according to Bloomberg.



Tesla’s shares have surged 56.4% in the past year.



So, what prompted Musk’s sell-off? Well, it could have been prompted by the “billionaires tax” that was earlier proposed by Democrats. In fact, the TSLA CEO tweeted, following the recent sell-off, that he anticipates paying more than $11 billion in taxes for 2021.



We will look at the billionaires tax proposal in more detail later in this article.



When it comes to Tesla’s investors, however, they remain very positive about the stock. According to the TipRanks Crowd Wisdom tool, 1.7% of portfolios out of 538,832 portfolios have upped their holding of TSLA in the past 30 days.







Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)



Jeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest behind Musk and the Executive Chairman and former CEO of Amazon, is also on a selling spree. Last year, Bezos sold shares worth $9 billion, still below the $10.2 billion worth of stock sold in 2020.



According to a Wall Street Journal report, the founder of Amazon sells around $10 billion worth of stock every year to “fund his space venture, Blue Origin LLC.”



Shares of AMZN have gone up only 4.1% in the past year, generally underperforming the U.S. stock-market indexes.



Still, Wall Street analysts envisage the stock to have an upside potential of 23.5% to current levels with an average Amazon price target of $4,137.50 and are bullish about it. They have rated the stock a Strong Buy based on the consensus of 30 Buys.







Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB)



Meta Platforms’ CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is another one who is offloading his shares, seemingly in a hurry. According to a Bloomberg report, the CEO sold stock on almost every weekday last year.



How much stock? Well, Zuckerberg sold around 13.8 million shares last year, landing him a windfall of $4.5 billion, almost eight times what he sold in 2020. This was even as FB’s price soared 24.2% in the past year. Zuckerberg sold only 1.5 million shares in 2020, at a value of $405 million.



What about other corporate insiders? Well, they are also selling shares, worth approximately $771 thousand to be precise, in the last three months, indicating that insider confidence signal is negative about the stock.



On the other hand, the stock offloading by Zuckerberg could possibly be prompted by his aim to donate more towards the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Around seven years back, following the birth of his daughter, the CEO of FB vowed to give away 99% of his shares towards charitable causes.



The negative confidence signal aside, analysts are bullish on FB. It is one of TipRanks Top Stocks, with a Strong Buy analysts’ consensus rating based on 29 Buys and 6 Holds.  The average Meta Platforms stock prediction of $406.31 implies upside potential of 20.7% to current levels.







Snap (NYSE: SNAP)



Evan Spiegel, CEO of social media giant Snap, has also been selling off stock. Spiegel received $710 million (before taxes) last year on the sale of 10.6 million shares, more than double his proceeds of $265.6 million in 2020. He sold around 15 million shares in 2020.



It is important here to note that corporate insiders can sell stocks either through a broker or through a 10b5-1 plan. The SEC’s 10b5 ruling allows insiders to trigger a trade for the stock in which a date or price is pre-set for the sale of the stock.



According to a Wall Street Journal report, the 10b5 plans were used in 66% of stock sales in 2020, more than double the figure of 30% in 2004.



So, why the stock sale? Are insiders turning bearish on SNAP? Even a look at SNAP’s Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks indicates that in the last 3 months alone, corporate insiders have sold shares worth more than $14.8 million, indicating that the insider confidence signal on the stock is very negative.



However, the most recent quarter SNAP stock earnings indicate that the company did well in the third quarter. Net loss improved year-over-year by 64% to a negative $72 million. Reported loss came in at $0.05 per share versus analysts' expectations of a loss of $0.10 per share. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, indicating an improvement of 209% from the same quarter of the previous year.







Block (NYSE: SQ)



Shares of Block have been in a free-fall over the past year as the stock dropped around 32%. There is also the possibility that this drop in stock price could have been exacerbated by the actions of the Founder and CEO of Block, Jack Dorsey, who sold off stock worth $445 million last year, more than thrice the shares worth $127 million that he sold off in 2020.



According to Block’s annual report filing, Dorsey is a controlling shareholder in the company. As a result, Dorsey’s sell-off can be perceived as a negative insider trading signal by retail investors.



But a factor behind Dorsey’s sell-off has also been his charitable ambitions. In 2020, he tweeted that he will be “moving” approximately $1 billion worth of his stake in Block, that is, around 28% of his wealth, to fund COVID-19 relief efforts globally. He added that this would be done through the arrangement of a limited liability company (LLC) that will operate transparently.



According to the TipRanks Insider Trading activity tool, corporate insiders have sold shares worth $43,900 in the last three months alone, indicating that the insider confidence signal in Block is negative.



But is this confidence in the company really declining? Looking at the transition that Block is currently undergoing, it doesn’t seem so. In December last year, the company announced its name change from Square to Block to acknowledge “the company’s growth.”



Earlier, SQ, founded in 2009, provided an ecosystem that catered to the Seller business and included commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers. Now renamed Block, SQ is also venturing into cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology.



Even analysts are cautiously optimistic about this transition for Block and have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the stock, based on 16 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Block stock prediction of $285.29 implies upside potential of 82.5% to current levels.







Billionaires Tax proposal



So, what was the billionaires tax that seems to have been nixed? Well, this proposal put forth the idea of taxing the top 10% wealthy individuals in the United States on “unrealized capital gains.”



These unrealized capital gains are defined as the increase in the value of assets like home, business stocks, and mutual funds, gained from holding on to these assets over a period of time. This proposal planned to levy taxes on these unrealized capital gains by valuing these assets annually.



Democrats had put forth this proposal in a bid to raise revenues as a part of an infrastructure and environment bill worth $2 trillion. President Biden had also proposed hiking the capital gains tax rate to 39.6%.



Additionally, this legislation proposes a 5% tax on adjusted gross income higher than $10 million. It also includes another tax of 3% on income above $25 million. The legislation, which seems to have been axed for now, includes capital gains earned from sales of stock. 



It appears that the sell-off by these CEOs could have been largely prompted by an attempt to avoid a hefty tax bill this year.

Amazon is a U.S. company that offers online retail shopping services. It also generates revenues from cloud computing. Amazon's earnings report for Q4 2021 is scheduled for February 03, 2022.



Amazon vs. Future Retail



In its defense, Future Retail argues that the proceedings in Singapore are based on a 2019 deal that India’s antitrust agency suspended. The Competition Commission of India suspended the 2019 deal, arguing that Amazon suppressed valuable information while seeking approvals.



The legal standoff in India and Singapore stems from Amazon using terms of its $200 million investment in Future Retail to block a sale of its retail assets. 



Amazon has dubbed the asset sale illegal, alleging it amounts to a breach of certain contracts. The retailer insists the deal has no legal existence in India as it does not have antitrust approval.



A Singapore arbitration panel is hearing the case, but Amazon and Future Retail have been fighting parallel cases in Indian courts. The U.S. retailer has already told the Singapore arbitrator that the CCI's suspension of the 2019 deal does not make the transaction void, as it has allowed Amazon to reapply for clearances.



Stock Rating



Last month, Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon and raised the price target to $4,500 from $4,300, implying 32.04% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, Amazon is his top pick for 2022. He expects sales growth to accelerate in the second quarter as e-commerce comps ease.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4127.50 implies 21.11% upside potential to current levels.

10792,"Amazon stock underperformed the market averages in 2021. It inched up 2.4% compared to a 29% increase in the Nasdaq 100 Index in 2021. 



Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) underperformance is due to several factors. Profit-taking post the stellar appreciation in its stock price and difficult year-over-year comparisons, especially in the first half of the year, remained a drag. 



Further, increased costs related to labor and supply-chain disruptions weighed on its margins, and in turn, its stock price. 



Amazon expects material cost inflation, wage increases, and labor-related productivity losses to impact its cost structure and margins in Q4. 



Given the softness in sales and pressure on margins, investors have been selling Amazon stock. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that about 1.1% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have decreased their exposure to AMZN stock in the last 30 days. 



What’s Ahead?



Brian White of Monness remains upbeat about Amazon’s prospects in 2022. White expects Amazon to deliver double-digit revenue growth in the 2H22. Notably, Amazon faces easier year-over-year comparisons for its e-commerce business in 2H22. 



Further, White remains positive on the recovery in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenues. He noted that “revenue growth at AWS was on the mend, resulting in three consecutive quarters of accelerating growth for the cloud service.” 



It’s worth noting that Amazon’s AWS revenue growth rate accelerated on a quarter-over-quarter basis. AWS sales marked 33%, 37%, and 39% growth, respectively, in the first three quarters of 2021. 



White added, “Amazon is uniquely positioned to emerge from this crisis as one of the biggest beneficiaries of accelerated digital transformation.” 



Along with White, Oliver Hu of Guggenheim is positive on Amazon and expects its market share gains to accelerate again by mid-FY22. Hu’s bullish outlook is based “on the potential for a significant positive inflection in early/mid 2022,” compared to the current moderating sales and margin trends. 



Wall Street’s Take



Besides White and Hu, Wall Street analysts maintain a favorable outlook on Amazon stock. AMZN’s Strong Buy rating consensus is based on 30 positive analyst reviews. 



Further, the average Amazon price target of $4,127.50 implies 21.1% upside potential to current levels.

10970,"Despite its muted forecast for full-year earnings, I am bullish on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Warren Buffett famously said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful."" The adage is true for several stocks out there. But Alibaba is perhaps the greatest example in the market right now.



The e-commerce giant is not having the best time as of late. Regulators in Beijing are sharpening their knives, and many large conglomerates are feeling the pinch. Alibaba is no different. Chinese regulators fined the company $2.8 billion for abusing its market dominance. It is important to note that the fine amounts to about 4% of its 2019 domestic revenue.



The slowdown of the Chinese economy is also weighing down sentiment. The company forecast that its annual revenue growth will slow down to a crawl this year, the worst since its listing in 2014.



Hence, BABA stock is taking a pasting these days. However, the fact that shares are trading at rock bottom prices right now means that there is the potential for opportunity. Alibaba is still head and shoulders above the other e-commerce companies active in its region.



Often referred to as the ""Amazon of China,"" operating metrics are generally rock solid. For those looking for a solid tech stock during the holiday season, look no further than BABA.



China's Growth Forecast Is Impacting Alibaba Stock



China's slowing economy has impacted consumption. There are multiple reasons why this is happening. First, China is employing a zero-COVID strategy. Although many countries in Asia have decided to live with the virus, China persists in this rigorous approach. The preparedness process includes strict lockdowns, even after just one or handfuls of cases have been detected. Naturally, it leads to a slowdown in the economy.



Additionally, the energy crisis in China is just one example of how the world's supply can be disrupted by high costs for coal and inflexible electricity prices. Due to the energy shortages, local governments enforce rolling blackouts, which primarily affect industries like steelmaking or manufacturing chemicals.



Finally, Evergrande, one of China's largest property developers, and its debt burden is still big news. Beijing is trying to deleverage the sector and pacify fears. However, panic has spread to other Chinese companies as they also halt or delay payments.



These factors are combined to create a tailspin for the Chinese economy. It grew at just 4.9% in Q3, a steep drop sequentially from the 7.9% expansion in the second quarter. Hence, Chinese companies are feeling the pinch due to a strained economic forecast, and Alibaba stock is no exception.



Quarterly Results Underscore Larger Issues



Over the years, Alibaba has cultivated a reputation as a solid performer. However, its recent quarterly earnings represent a rare misstep. In the BABA earnings release, the e-commerce juggernaut posted Q2 revenue of 200.69 billion yuan ($31.4 billion), representing year-over-year growth of 29%. EPS came in at 11.20 yuan, a 38% dip from the year-ago period. Both revenue and EPS figures missed estimates.



Customer Management Revenue, or CMR, is the company's bread and butter. That segment, in particular, is struggling. Revenues from this area rose just 3% from the year-ago period.



A bright spot, though, is Cloud Computing. Investors are closely monitoring this area. The segment has been on a tear, jumping 33% to make up 20 billion yuan in revenue. This year's EBITA was 396 million yuan versus a 567 million yuan loss last year, proving that the company is turning things around. Moving forward, the growth of this segment will become a lynchpin of the company's overall strategy.



As highlighted in the earlier section, the Chinese economic slowdown affects BABA. However, the other major issue is Chinese regulatory concern. The Chinese government is clamping down on the domestic technology industry. Antitrust and data protection are taking center stage. 



For years, Chinese tech giants grew unabated. However, Beijing now wants to regulate the behavior of the domestic technology industry. The fine of $2.8 billion in April becomes understandable in this context.



Looking ahead, BABA cut its revenue guidance for Fiscal Year 2022. Previously, the company had forecast 930 billion yuan, a year-over-year jump of 29.5%. However, now it expects much more conservative revenue growth within the range of 20% to 23%.



Management Shuffle



In light of slowing performance, Alibaba is looking to shake things up. Hence, longtime finance chief Maggie Wu is stepping down from her position. Deputy CFO Toby Xu will be the main CFO starting in April 2022.



In a press release, Wu cited her retirement as the ""culmination of extensive preparation over many years"" and said it would allow new blood injection into the management circle.



Alibaba is creating two new divisions — International Digital Commerce and China Digital Commerce. The change is aimed to reverse slowing growth and create a clearer path to growth and value creation. The international business division will manage the company's operations in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia, among other places.



Alibaba has tapped 36-year old executive Jiang Fan to lead its overseas division. Meanwhile, Trudy Dai will take care of the domestic e-commerce business operations. Jiang led Taobao's push into mobile and was seen as a contender to take the reins of Alibaba Group until he became embroiled in a personal scandal last year.



AMZN Forecast Versus Alibaba



The two biggest companies in e-commerce are Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba. The fight for global leadership has been a long one. The two companies have been going head-to-head as they both strive to become the world's leading online retailers. 



Amazon launched in 1995, whereas Alibaba started up less than five years later. The former has taken over American retail, while Alibaba rules China's e-commerce market.



However, the business models of Amazon and Alibaba couldn't be more different, with the former being an e-commerce company while the latter is operating as either a retail site or auction house.



You cannot go wrong investing in either one. But at the moment, Alibaba is the better stock. The AMZN forecast doesn't call for much upside. In comparison, due to the issues BABA faces domestically, this one is trading at a huge discount.



Wall Street's Take



The sentiment for Alibaba on Wall Street is turning bullish. The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 20 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Alibaba stock forecast of $203.05 implies 76.9% upside potential.







Alibaba Stock Forecast Implies Huge Upside Potential



Understandably, BABA has seen better times. Alibaba is still investing heavily in new business lines as its core e-commerce business peaks and profitability slows.



If things stabilize next year, then BABA stockholders will be laughing all the way to the bank. According to Goldman Sachs, the Alibaba Group is the largest e-commerce player in China, with an estimated 69% market share for 2020.



Considering its history and size, Alibaba is a value play at the moment. Much of what is happening with the company has nothing to do with its operations. Instead, you can chalk most of that up to the intense regulatory environment in China. Nevertheless, the Alibaba stock forecast is solid. The fact that shares are available at a discount is more than enough reason to consider it.

10993,"I am bullish on Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Walmart's financial chief, Brett Biggs, has made a surprising announcement. He announced that the company hasn't seen any early holiday shoppers this year. It is weighing down sentiment for WMT stock. 



It is a shame considering the history of the business and its strong outlook. Walmart has a leg up on competitors this year because it's likely that it'll be able to offer customers what they need when their favorite items sell out. 



Therefore, the retail juggernaut is in a prime position to succeed. It is just coming off a great quarter. Plus, the international market is progressing at a  decent clip. 



Compared to some of the major hyper-growth stocks out there like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), Walmart often gets lost in the shuffle. For value investors, that is a good thing. It means shares of this solid company are available at a huge discount compared to its peers. During the holiday season, the company is forecast to dominate retail sales. 



The AMZN forecast is also positive. It's the ""800-pound gorilla"" in the room. However, WMT is available at a higher discount and upside. Income investors will also value it higher due to continuously growing upcoming dividends. 



WMT vs. AMZN Forecast



For retail companies, the fourth quarter is always a bonanza. The final week of holiday shopping is in full swing, with retailers preparing for a wild ride. It is a breath of fresh air for companies like Walmart and Amazon. 



Amazon (AMZN) is dominating the online shopping world. Shoppers paid $610 billion to Amazon during the trailing twelve months to June 2021. Walmart earned $566 billion during the same period. Hence, JP Morgan is confident Amazon will become the No. 1 retailer in America next year. 



Nevertheless, Walmart is still a very robust enterprise. Additionally, Amazon could become even more vulnerable to antitrust measures by exceeding Walmart in terms of revenue than ever.



It is also important to put things into context. Amazon is unstoppable at this point. Consequently, most companies are feeling the pinch. It is the same feeling media companies feel when they look at Netflix (NFLX). On its own, Walmart is a behemoth in the retail industry, and it doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon.



Quarterly Earnings Repose Confidence



Walmart's third-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' expectations by a mile. The retailer reported better-than-expected numbers, with price-sensitive shoppers flocking to its stores as the grocery industry continues seeing rising costs for household staples.



The best thing for Walmart coming out of earnings season is the robustness of its supply chain. The retailer also charters its own ships, so there are no hiccups in supply. Therefore, Walmart stands amongst a select few companies effectively managing the current supply chain crisis. 



Walmart CEO Doug McMillon reaffirmed this sentiment. Inventory for the U.S. is up 11.5% in anticipation of the busy holiday season. Hence, the chances of running out of inventory are slim. The retailer has been preparing for the holidays early and prioritizes key products on ships.



In light of this impressive performance, Walmart upped its guidance. The retailer now forecasts adjusted earnings per share of approximately $6.40 for the year. Previously, the company was forecasting earnings in the range of $6.20 to $6.35. 



Walmart Dividends



Walmart is a company that has been paying and growing its dividend since 1974, making it worthy of any income investor. The retailer is always at the top of the list whenever income investors look for upcoming dividends. 



Walmart, a Dividend Aristocrat and two years from becoming the next Dividend King, has an enticing dividend yield of 1.58%. A Dividend Aristocrat is an S&P 500 company paying and hiking its base dividend for a minimum of 25 consecutive years. 



Wall Street's Take



Wall Street is betting big on Walmart. On TipRanks, 18 Wall Street analysts offer 12-month price targets for Walmart. The big-box retailer carries a Strong Buy consensus based on 15 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months.



The 12-month Walmart price target is $172.11 on TipRanks, implying an upside of 21%. 







AMZN Forecast Not Enough to Edge Walmart



The holiday season is like a World Series, Superbowl, and Stanley Cup for retailers. Amazon and Walmart are the two biggest e-commerce retailers on the planet. Naturally, they both will rake in billions.



Walmart's revenue in 2021 is expected to be $559 billion. Still, its e-commerce sales only represent 13.4% of that total which means the majority comes from traditional brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart locations across America. That will irk investors, especially since the e-commerce trend is secular. 



However, Amazon is not without its struggles. It's not surprising that the e-commerce giant recently reported an even sharper-than-expected drop in earnings, as it was hit hard by supply chain issues and had its staff stretched thin. Hence, the rosy AMZN forecast needs to be put into context.



Due to a combination of dividends, robust outlook, and solid fundamentals, Walmart is a stable investment for any portfolio.

11021,"CEO of customer relationship management platform Salesforce (CRM), Marc Benioff, retweeted a very interesting post. The post, shared by popular anchor and correspondent Jon Erlichman, contains an image of Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon (AMZN), on the cover page of Time magazine in 1999. This was the year when Bezos was named Time person of the year, having raked in $1.5 billion in annual revenues. Interestingly, in the post, Erlichman pointed out that that is exactly the amount Amazon generated on a per-day basis in 2021.



Though the caption of the post is a bit of an exaggeration, it is true that Amazon crossed the average $1 billion-a-day mark in 2020, the year it brought in $386.1 billion in annual revenues. This highlights the manifold growth that Amazon has achieved over the years, under the leadership of Bezos.



In contrast, Salesforce has a long way to go before arriving where Amazon stands now, in terms of revenues. Its annual revenues for fiscal 2021 came up to $21.3 billion.



However, both are leaders in their own rights. While Amazon reigns in the e-commerce and cloud spaces, Salesforce is a dominant player in the customer relationship management market. Salesforce’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model focuses on salesforce automation, customer responsiveness and support, software, social media monitoring and marketing, and other social enterprise areas.



Interestingly, Salesforce revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 51.22% over the last 20 years, while Amazon went from $1.5 billion in 1999 to $386.1 billion in 2020. In its last reported quarter, Salesforce generated revenues of $6.86 billion, representing a climb of 27% year-over-year.

11041,"After some stellar performances during a pandemic stricken 2020, global e-commerce stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN), have generally underperformed the broader market so far in 2021. 



However, e-commerce retailer ContextLogic (WISH) stock ranks among the worst decliners this year as it prints an 82% year-to-date fall at the time of writing. I am neutral on WISH stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



ContextLogic runs the wish.com online store and associated mobile applications across the world. Retail store reopenings and easing lockdowns combined to steal business from online stores, but that doesn't explain WISH stock's painful decline in 2021.



Contrarian investors looking for bargain buy-the-dip ideas to play for 2022 are very much likely to study WISH stock during this festive season. Could the recently listed e-commerce company rise above its current challenges and rise again in the new year?



A critical look at the company's problems and proposed solutions could help answer the above million-dollar question.



ContextLogic (WISH) Stock’s Problems in 2021



ContextLogic suffered a massive exodus of users from its platforms in 2021.



Despite a general decline in e-commerce traffic globally as physical stores reopened their doors and people left their homes after months in COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns, wish.com had unique challenges of its own.



Users complained of product quality issues and unreasonably lengthy returns processing turnaround times before an application ban in France. Quality control issues may be linked to an influx of cheap Asian vendors whose products' quality fell far below European market standards. Some products have been labeled dangerous for French consumers lately.



Popular mobile app stores, including Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play Store responded by removing the WISH app from the affected market. Search engines followed suit by blocking search traffic to the company's platform.



Before the France fallout, ContextLogic had taken drastic measures to address quality control issues by actively assessing vendors, offering financial incentives to attract high-quality vendors, and establishing logistics services to address customer concerns.



That said, average active buyer numbers have been declining throughout the year. The company suspended advertising expenditures to limit cash bleed and contain losses as it dealt with its issues, and customer churn worsened during the third quarter.



User traffic decline could be worse for the fourth quarter of 2021.



Website Traffic to the Wish Store Spells Disaster



Amazingly, a recent visit to the wish.com online store on the web shows most items as ""out of stock,"" which leaves me wondering what the company was selling throughout the festive season if its web store looks empty.



Anyway, activity should be better on the Wish mobile apps. Products were definitely available on some nicely branded vending machines.



That said, I am very much concerned about the potential decline in user numbers during the fourth quarter of 2021.



Investors already know that ContextLogic has been losing users on its e-commerce platform. The company used to serve over 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) before going public in December 2020. The number dropped to around 60 million during the third quarter of this year.



The decline in the wish.com user base is startling.



A quick check on wish.com's recent website traffic using the TipRanks' web traffic analysis tool shows a serious drop in wish.com and merchant.wish.com websites' traffic so far during the fourth quarter of 2021.







In November 2020, there were about 158 million visits to wish.com. The number declined by nearly 57% year-over-year to around 68.1 million for November 2021.



Quarter to date numbers (October and November numbers) show a similar 56% annual decline from 300 million visits estimated for the same months last year to just around 132.2 million. This is despite the fact that people reportedly started shopping early for this year's festive season due to persistent global supply chain challenges.



ContextLogic seems to be in trouble still. In comparison, Amazon website traffic declined by 26.5% for November and is down 28.6% for the first two months of the fourth quarter.



Opportunities for WISH Stock Recovery in 2022



To curb customer churn, ContextLogic introduced a ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) option and shoppable videos from which users can purchase an item from a demo video, and these innovations target attracting new shoppers and merchants to the wish.com platform.



WISH is offering financial incentives to attract quality vendors. It's offering discounts and coupons to users too. If these strategies work, business volumes may recover, but profitability may suffer in the short term.



The company also expanded its own proprietary logistics network to help reduce delivery delays and improve logistics lead times. Logistics revenue has been growing lately.



That said, the company still revealed that sales for October were down by about 20% despite an early holiday shopping season. Revenue declines could still persist into 2022.



Fortunately, WISH had more than $1 billion in cash resources on its balance sheet in September. The company seems to have adequate liquidity to see it through its business re-configuration strategy next year.



Most concerning is the company's CEO and Founder Piotr Szulczewski's announced premature departure in November. Although Piotr will retain a Board seat, the founder's leadership would have been essential during a turnaround strategy in 2022.



Most noteworthy, Piotr's departure right now makes him ineligible to receive his allocation of 10 million shares of the company received in a stock incentive plan when the company went public a year ago. The shares could have been vested if he remained with the company until December 2022.



I find it concerning that a company's founder is ready to jump ship and leave millions on the table, just as the company needs guidance the most. Could the company's problems be so profound and severe that the founder feels overwhelmed?



WISH will reverse the $16 million it had recognized under stock-based compensation expenses related to the outgoing CEO's forfeited benefit.



Investor Takeaway



ContextLogic stock could potentially recover some lost value in 2022 as it reinstates advertising spending, improves logistics challenges, and improves offered product quality.



That said, the company needs to find a new leader urgently, and pray that its French problem won't spill into other European markets.



WISH's generated 38% of its market revenue from Europe during the past quarter. The region remains a significant revenue-generating market, and it will be too expensive to lose a key market.



Until the company stabilizes its customer churn, begins to grow user traffic, and stabilizes its recently elevated cash burn rates, WISH stock could face more downward pressure in the near term.



For contrarian investors confident in the company's turnaround prospects, this could be the best time to start deploying capital and be greedy when others are still fearful.



TipRanks' Smart Score



That said, the TipRanks Smart Score ranking system predicts that WISH stock could still underperform the market as of right now.







Wall Street's Take



Wall Street analysts give WISH stock a Moderate Sell rating based on four Holds and two Sell ratings assigned during the past three months. 



The average WISH stock price target of $4.92 implies a potential 46.4% upside over the next twelve months.

11084,"In recent years, Brick-and-mortar retail behemoth Walmart (WMT) has been on the receiving end of the e-commerce rise, but it has taken steps to adapt. Not only can it keep up with the times, but it may actually be able to compete better and claw back some of the business lost to popular e-tailers, most notably Amazon (AMZN).



Furthermore, it's not just continued e-commerce investments that could fuel a multiple expansion at WMT stock. In many ways, the firm's Walmart+ offering seems to rhyme with an earlier version of Amazon Prime.



Indeed, Walmart can't stop at just quick delivery of physical goods, though. It needs to do more to take the growth at Walmart+ to the next level. The brick-and-mortar retailer may have to offer intriguing tech services to its arsenal to improve the underlying value proposition of Walmart+, especially amid ongoing COVID-induced pressures that may not be so quick to fade in the new year.



I think Walmart has the technological capabilities to become an omnichannel powerhouse over the coming years, as it looks to take a page out of Amazon's Prime playbook with its Walmart+ service.



With a modest 0.7 times sales multiple, I remain bullish on the stock, as it looks to make up for lost time.



Is Walmart+ Ready for Prime Time?



Amazon's Prime service offers an incredible value for the average consumer, with Prime Video, Music, Gaming services, a complimentary monthly Twitch subscription, and a wide range of other benefits thrown in to further sweeten the Prime pot.



Indeed, it's proven tough for many consumers to cancel their Prime memberships, even if COVID supply chain issues have lengthened delivery times for particular consumers.



In Canada, COVID's impact has weighed heavily on delivery times and merchandise availability. Shipping times for Prime-eligible products were shrinking before the pandemic. That all changed when the insidious Coronavirus arrived.



Despite lengthened delivery times and waning supply for certain items, a concerning flood of Prime cancellations didn't really happen. Why?



With so much must-watch content on Prime Video and other services that many subscribers have grown accustomed to, Prime has become too sticky thanks to services that go beyond shopping.



Walmart+ could become just as sticky over the coming years as it looks to tear a page out of Amazon's playbook by adding sweeteners in the form of complementary, value-adding services. Such services could be vital to making any subscription that much stickier.



Walmart+ Needs Extra Perks to Make It Stickier



Walmart CFO Bret Biggs really focused on growing Walmart+ in a conference call held a few months ago. For now, Walmart is striving to achieve best-in-class customer service in physical and digital. With a digital third-party seller platform that falls short of Amazon's, though, Walmart will need to go the extra mile to offer subscribers a value proposition they can't refuse.



Indeed, a solid omnichannel experience can help Walmart differentiate itself from Amazon, with brick-and-mortar-focused membership perks such as member price on fuel. Amid COVID-19 waves, though, a growing number of consumers will choose to stay at home, bringing forth the need for more digital perks such as video, gaming, and cloud storage.



The good news is that Walmart appears to be hard at work to create its own tech-driven services behind the scenes. The company has reportedly been working on a cloud-gaming service for many years now. Whether it'll be a perk included in the Walmart+ membership remains to be seen. 



Regardless, Walmart does appear to be en route to improving its value proposition to better compete with Amazon. For that reason, Walmart stock is easy to get behind after a year of doing virtually nothing.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Walmart has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 15 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Walmart price target of $172.11 implies 23.4% upside potential.

11118,"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) provides an e-commerce platform, facilitating the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions all around the world. I am bullish on the stock.



As businesses get bigger, they can make more money -- and have more problems.



While Amazon's business is undoubtedly thriving amid a COVID-19-induced renaissance in online commerce, politicians and governmental agencies may apply stronger scrutiny.



As the regulatory screws tighten, Amazon's price-to-earnings ratio -- which is around 67 for the trailing 12-month period -- may decline. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as market opportunists can jump into the trade at a more attractive price point.



Getting Too Big 



Value hunters certainly wouldn't mind if AMZN stock fell towards the $3,000 level. Could harsh government enforcement actions cause this to happen in 2022?



It's definitely possible, as two U.S. senators are already looking to probe into Amazon’s labor practices.



The two senators are Florida's Marco Rubio and Ohio's Sherrod Brown. They issued a joint letter to Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, stating that one out of every 170 U.S. workers is an Amazon employee.



The implication, supposedly, is that Amazon is getting too big and may be in violation of fair employment practices. Indeed, Amazon is massive as the company is the world's fourth-largest company by market capitalization.



Amazon also happens to be the second-largest employer in the U.S., and the onset of COVID-19 only seems to have increased the company's already vast influence.



If this investigation snowballs into something bigger and more worrisome, the AMZN stock price could shed some of its value in the short term -- and that's when contrarian traders could consider taking a long position.



An Even Deeper Probe, Potentially



Even more potentially problematic is a separate governmental investigation, which could really sour investors' sentiment surrounding Amazon.



In particular, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly advancing an antitrust probe into Amazon's cloud computing business. That's according to Bloomberg News, which cited people familiar with the matter.



Allegedly, FTC officials contacted companies during the past few months in order to gather information about competition-related issues concerning Amazon Web Services (AWS).



Moreover, this probe appears to be a continuation of an investigation that was started during the previous U.S. presidential administration.



Evidently, neither Amazon nor the FTC has confirmed the current probe. Consequently, the full impact of these reported events might not be witnessed in the AMZN stock price for a while.



Nevertheless, prospective investors should keep an eye out for further developments.



Wall Street’s Take



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, Amazon is a Strong Buy, based on 30 unanimous Buy ratings. The average AMZN forecast is $4,127.50, implying 20.4% upside potential.







The Takeaway



It's not likely that any regulatory probe will have a permanent negative impact on the AMZN stock price. As we've discussed, Amazon is a huge company with wide-reaching influence in the U.S. and elsewhere.



Clearly, the analysts already know this; 30 out of 30 of them are bullish on Amazon.



So, if the government decides to clamp down on Amazon, don't fret.

As a result, various apps and websites, including streaming service Hulu, office messaging app Slack, and Epic Games, were temporarily hit.



Details



Slack mentioned that its file uploads, message editing and other services faced problems.



Amazon stated that its platform that provides computing capacity to cloud networks operated by its unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was impacted by the outage.



However, all the services were up and running after some time. Amazon Web Services stated, “The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.”



Earlier this month, one of the FAANG Stocks Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) was hit by a major outage in the same region. Furthermore, Disney+, trading app Robinhood and Amazon’s E-commerce website were also impacted at that time.



Analysts Recommendation



On December 14, UBS Analyst Lloyd Walmsley reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon with the price target of $4700 (37.4% upside potential)



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon stock price prediction of $4,127.50 implies 20.82% upside potential to current levels.



Smart Score 



Amazon scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Hiring Plan 



Amazon’s move is part of its multi-city expansion plan across the country and company. It plans to create 3,000 jobs across Austin, Chicago, and Phoenix. As part of its hiring plan, through innovative new programs, Amazon is creating opportunities for all levels of candidates to join the company.  



Phoenix Tech Hub 



Amazon will create over 550 jobs in Tempe, Arizona, to expand the company’s Phoenix Tech Hub. With the employment of software development engineers, senior solution architects, project managers, and business analysts, the company plans to grow its Consumer Retail, Amazon Web Services, and Operations teams. Currently, more than 5,000 tech and corporate employees are working at the hub. 



Amazon plans to create additional new office space and has signed on to a 63,000-square-foot expansion at its existing offices in Tempe. The new offices are expected to open in late 2022. 



An official at Amazon’s Phoenix Tech Hub, Doug Welzel, said, ""We’ve experienced amazing growth over the last few years, creating jobs and economic opportunity for the wider community. We’ve already created more than 5,000 corporate and tech jobs in the Phoenix area and we are excited to continue investing here."" 



Austin Tech Hub 



As per the company’s plan, over 2,000 jobs will be created in Austin, Texas to expand the company’s Austin Tech Hub. The new roles of senior data engineers, senior technical program managers, user experience designers, and financial analysts will support the teams at Operations Technology, Amazon Retail, Amazon Business, and Amazon Web Services. Currently, more than 3,000 tech and corporate employees are employed at the hub. 



Additional new office space has been planned for new roles, which is expected to open in early 2024. 



Site lead officer at Amazon’s Austin Tech Hub, Doug Gray, said, “Our continued investment in Austin is a testament to the amazing talent and amenities that this city has to offer. With more than 3,000 jobs already created and more than 1,000 corporate and technology roles currently available, we’re looking forward to continue offering exciting career opportunities to local residents.” 



Wall Street’s Take 



Recently, UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $4,700 (37.9% upside potential) on the stock.  



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,127.50 implies 21.1% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 6.3% over the past year. 



Website Traffic 



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (NYSE: SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance this quarter. According to the tool, the Amazon website recorded a 26.53% decrease in global visits in November compared to the same period last year. Also, a quarter-to-date comparison showed a decrease of 28.58% compared to Q4 2020, and the year-to-date website traffic decline stands at 5.09%.

11747,"According to a report published by StreetInsider.com, Italy’s antitrust regulator has imposed a fine of $1.28 billion on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) for taking undue advantage of its dominant market position.



Shares of the company were trading 0.5% down, at the time of writing, in the early trading session on Thursday. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



What Did the Regulator Say?



The regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), said that the E-commerce giant was hurting competitors by pushing for its own logistics service, FBA, to the sellers on its platform.



Amazon does this “to the detriment of the logistics services offered by competing operators, as well as to strengthen its own dominant position,” AGCM added.



Amazon’s Response



An Amazon spokesperson said, “Small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.”



Wall Street’s Take



Recently, UBS (UBS) analyst Kunal Madhukar initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $4,700 (33.4% upside potential).



The analyst is of the view that Amazon has “multiple levers” to drive margin growth.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon.com price target of $4,120.83 implies 17% upside potential. Shares have gained 13.5% over the past year.



Website Traffic



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance.



According to the tool, compared to the previous year, the company’s website traffic registered a 26.5% fall in global visits in November. Moreover, the website traffic has decreased 5.1% year-to-date against the same period last year.

11754,"Shares of natural and organic food company United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI) jumped 13.2%, after the company reported robust third-quarter results and reaffirmed its full-year guidance.



Despite ongoing supply chain and labor challenges, UNFI managed to beat both earnings and sales estimates. With the pandemic still persistent, customers prefer at-home food solutions and UNFI is well-positioned to execute the growing demand.  



Robust Results



The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share, a whopping 90.2% year-over-year growth, significantly outpacing analysts' estimates of $0.50 per share.



Moreover, net sales came in at $7 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year, marginally outpacing Street estimates of $6.8 billion. The sales growth was aided by favorable pricing trends, and growing demand from new and existing customers. However, these were partially offset by supply chain headwinds.



Management Comments



CEO of UNFI, Sandy Douglas, said, “I’m pleased with our start to fiscal 2022 and how UNFI is navigating a challenging operating environment while simultaneously investing for the future, including improved distribution capabilities and new facilities, to better serve our customers.”



See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks >>



Reaffirms Outlook



Based on current business momentum, UNFI reaffirmed its full-year fiscal 2022 outlook.



The company forecasts FY22 net sales to be between $27.8 billion to $28.3 billion, against the consensus estimate of $28.02 billion.



Additionally, adjusted earnings are projected to fall in the range of $3.90 per share to $4.20 per share, while the consensus estimate is pegged at $4.09 per share.



Analysts’ View



Responding to the company’s quarterly performance, MKM Partners analyst William Kirk maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $62, which implies 11.5% upside potential to current levels.



Buy rating stocks come with a host of positive catalysts. Kirk lists these factors to base his optimistic view of the stock, including inflation boosting growth, fee income from promotional activities resuming soon, and the deal with Key Foods, which will accelerate growth.



Further, the analyst notes certain United Natural Foods stock risks, including the company's independent customers losing share to larger conventional grocery stores, and non-renewal of its contract with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 2 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average United Natural Foods price target of $49.17 implies 11.58% downside potential to current levels. However, shares have exploded 245.2% over the past year.

11963,"Online retailer and cloud computing specialist Amazon (AMZN) has pretty much conquered the retail landscape. It's now an indispensable part of shopping, not just in America, but worldwide as well. Its latest move demonstrates its sheer diversity as a brand as well. That combination of retail primacy and enormous versatility keeps me deeply bullish on Amazon as a whole.



Looking at Amazon's stock charts for the year so far demonstrates its incredible value for shareholders. Despite a series of ups and downs, the company's share price spent less than a week, throughout this entire year, valued at less than $3,000 per share. 



Though the company has seen plenty of spikes and retractions, its overall trajectory for the year has been largely upward. There was a substantial loss between mid-February and early March. However, the company recovered from that rapidly enough and established its first of a series of highs for 2021. (See Amazon stock charts on TipRanks)



The latest move from the company, meanwhile, demonstrates its growing versatility. Amazon, working with Goldman Sachs (GS), established GS Financial Cloud for Data with Amazon Web Services. The move is part of a larger effort on Goldman Sachs' part to deliver access to its market data, as well as its software tools, to customers who may find it useful. Amazon's efforts will provide the technological underpinnings to the Goldman Sachs project. This isn't the first such project Amazon has had a hand in, and it likely won't be the last, either.



Users of GS Financial Cloud for Data with Amazon Web Services will find a range of tools available to them. One such tool gives them the ability to chart the relationship between a certain stock and currency exchange rates. Such a project might have taken months before, reports noted, but with the new tools, it would take only several minutes instead.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating. That's based on 31 Buys assigned in the past three months. The average Amazon price target of $4,116.94 implies 21.5% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $3,800 per share to a high of $4,700 per share.







Retail's Gold Standard Branches Out



Amazon was formidable enough when it became the answer to brick-and-mortar retail worldwide. Online retail used to be a highly fragmented affair, made up of dozens, if not thousands, of individual websites and shops. Now, Amazon has centralized that process, and brought millions of shoppers under one umbrella. That alone would make Amazon worth a Buy. Maybe not a $3,800 Buy, but a Buy nonetheless. There's a lot to be said for convenience, and its accessibility to small businesses doesn't hurt either.



Amazon's branching into cloud computing, though, is what takes it from a solid Buy to a very good Buy indeed. Retail is capricious. The second there's an economic downturn and customers start pulling in their collective wallets, that sends the retailer into a spiral as well. Even as we've seen lately, retailers are also at the mercy of the supply chain. People had plenty of money they were willing to spend, but there was increasingly less merchandise to spend it on.



Meanwhile, Amazon took steps to become more than just a provider of retail products. Today, Amazon Web Services serves as the underpinnings of a huge chunk of the internet. In fact, a Canalys report from the first quarter of 2021 noted that Amazon Web Services represents 32% of worldwide cloud infrastructure.



By way of comparison, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure makes up 19%, and Google (GOOGL) Cloud has 7%. That means Amazon Web Services accounts for more of cloud computing infrastructure than its two closest competitors combined, and that's just for starters. Amazon Web Services has been spotted working with companies like Volkswagen (VWAGY) to standardize its computing platforms. With services ranging from short-term data storage to long-term data archival and beyond, Amazon Web Services' versatility makes it attractive, and makes Amazon itself attractive by proxy.



Concluding Views



If Amazon were merely the web's biggest retailer, it would still be a worthwhile buy. Too many companies are routing too many goods, to too many people, for it not to be attractive. What justifies Amazon's massive valuation, and provides the potential for increase, is its web services operation. The latest move it's made with Goldman Sachs simply underscores that potential.



Amazon will sell you just about anything you can buy legally online. That's great, in and of itself. When it also provides the infrastructure to make shopping online or using certain tools or even going to websites possible, that only improves the situation. Amazon may be pricey, and trading near its highs, but Amazon may have not even found what those highs are just yet. Investing in Amazon is investing in its next leg up, which looks increasingly more likely to happen.

12016,"Shares of e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN) followed in the footsteps of the S&P 500 lower amid fears of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. Omicron, labeled as a variant of concern, threatens to slow the world economy's recovery. Despite this, the Federal Reserve is still set to raise rates in 2022.



Indeed, stocks have been quite volatile. With various European nations at the cusp of locking down, investors must face the reality that the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over. As we learn more about the Omicron variant, investors may fear that things could get ugly again, as they were in 2020.



However, I remain incredibly bullish on Amazon stock and think the Omicron-driven pullback is unwarranted. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Omicron Variant Risks Ahead



Omicron variant risks are real, but investors need not panic. While the variant may be a cause for concern, there are vaccines, test kits, and enhanced safety protocols like vaccine passports to help minimize the impact of localized outbreaks. 



Whether or not Omicron sends full lockdowns sweeping through the U.S. remains to be seen. Regardless, investors should look to Amazon stock as one of the names that should rally or at the very least hold its own amid renewed COVID-19 fears.



Amazon got a major boost in 2020 when physical stores locked down, and consumers turned to digital retailers. Should Omicron pause or even reverse the economic reopening, Amazon is bound to see at least a partial return of the pandemic tailwinds that mostly faded this year.



Moreover, with a low bar set on consumer spending for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the coming holiday season, Amazon could have the means to really impress once it finally pulls the curtain on its final quarter of 2021. 



Amazon May Be a Hedge against Further Lockdowns



With or without Omicron-induced lockdowns, Amazon looks positioned to sustain a breakout to much higher levels. Even if consumer spending grinds to a slowdown, more heightened COVID fears are likely to see Amazon take some share away from firms operating primarily in the physical realm. 



Any such variant-induced sales boosts could help the company move past recent inflationary woes that weighed heavily on margins in its most recent quarter.



Undoubtedly, Amazon strives to keep costs low, even as wage and shipping prices rise. The Great Resignation has also made it tough to retain and attract talent. While the recent trajectory of operating margins may be discouraging, such margin pressures are likely to be transitory in nature.



In spite of pressures applied by a less favorable macro environment, Amazon's third-quarter results remained close to the middle of the original guidance. Still, Q3 earnings did fall well short of consensus estimates (EPS of $6.12 versus the $8.92 consensus), derailing Amazon stock's breakout hopes.



In due time, inflation is bound to cool off. With a potential COVID lockdown-induced sales boost thrown into the equation, Amazon has the means to sustain a rally after over a year of consolidating in the low-to-mid $3,000 range.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 31 Buys assigned in the past three months. the average Amazon price target of $4,116.94 implies 19.8% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $3,800.00 per share to a high of $4,700.00 per share.







The Bottom Line on Amazon Stock



Through most of 2021, Amazon swam against the tide. Going into the new year, the tides may very well turn in its direction again, which could bode incredibly well for a stock that I believe is one of the cheapest of the FAANG cohort.



All 31 analysts covering the e-commerce giant have Buy ratings on the stock, and for good reason.

The two entities will combine their expertise to build a state-of-the-art, cloud-based infrastructure for the world’s capital markets. Shares of NDAQ closed down 2.8% at $203.23 on November 30.



Since 2008, Nasdaq has used AWS’s elasticity and high security to deliver client-driven solutions. With the partnership, Nasdaq will start migrating its North American markets to AWS in a phased manner starting in 2022. The first to migrate will be Nasdaq MRX, which is a U.S. options market, followed by the rest.



Cutting Edge Technology for Capital Markets



Both entities have co-developed a new edge computing solution exclusively designed for market infrastructure. The solution will also use AWS Outposts, which can extend its infrastructure, services, and tools to any datacenter, location, or space, or on-premise facility. The AWS Outposts enable ultra-low latency edge computing capabilities and Nasdaq intends to incorporate it into its core network. This will make Nasdaq the first-ever private AWS Local Zone for the capital markets industry.



The new infrastructure will provide Nasdaq’s clients ease of usage and high-frequency trading capabilities, coupled with access to virtual connectivity services, market analytics, and machine learning. Additionally, the new solution will accelerate Nasdaq’s business and enable the exchange to effortlessly transact billions of dollars in daily trades.



The solution could also be used by other market participants and exchanges to migrate their trading systems to the cloud.



Solutions for the Global Economy



In addition to the current partnership, both entities will also explore ways to use AWS’s cloud capabilities across other Nasdaq solutions including anti-financial crime, data and analytics, and market infrastructure software solutions.



Nasdaq has over 130 infrastructure clients including exchanges, banks, clearinghouses, central securities depositories, and regulators. These clients rely on Nasdaq for activities such as core trading, clearing, settlement, and surveillance technology. For the effective functioning of these activities, Nasdaq plans to partner with AWS to build viable public cloud and hybrid models.

CEO of AWS, Adam Selipsky, said, “Together, Nasdaq and AWS will change what’s possible for capital markets organizations, helping them to speed up innovation and improve business processes… Our partnership will give Nasdaq a way to more easily move their core infrastructure to the cloud and innovate new services as they continue their second decade of cloud adoption.”

The newly launched service will include the built-in capabilities for creating digital twins, such as connecting to data across disparate sources, modeling physical environments, and visualization of data.



Digital twins mimic the structure, state, and behavior of the objects they represent. They are virtual representations of physical systems that are regularly updated with real-world data.



It will enable faster and easier creation of digital twins of real-world systems like buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines.



This, in turn, will help clients build applications that mirror real-world systems, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reducing downtime.



Notably, the new service does not have up-front commitments or fees to use the AWS IoT TwinMaker. Customers using AWS IoT TwinMaker include Carrier, Siemens, and Accenture, to name a few.

Management Weighs In



Michael MacKenzie, GM at AWS IoT, commented, “Customers are excited about the opportunity to use digital twins to improve their operations and processes, but the work involved in creating a digital twin and custom applications for different use cases is complicated, expensive, and prohibitive for most.”



He added, “With today’s launch of AWS IoT TwinMaker, more customers can now have a holistic view of their industrial equipment, facilities, and processes to monitor and optimize all of their operations in real time.”

12135,"Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) were trading 1.2% up, at the time of writing, in the early trading session on Wednesday after the company announced plans to invest in 18 new wind and solar energy projects in Europe and the U.S.



The technology firm is based out of Seattle and offers E-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services.



Details of the Projects



The 18 wind and solar energy projects will be spread across the U.S., Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K., and will boast of a procured capacity of 5.6 gigawatts (GW) so far this year.



These 18 projects will take the company’s total number of renewable energy projects across the globe to 274. They will also help Amazon power all its business operations with renewable energy by 2025, five years earlier than its original target of 2030.



Once these projects become completely operational, they will take AMZN's total committed renewable electricity production capacity to more than 12 GW and 33,700 gigawatt hours (GWh), which is equivalent to powering more than 3 million U.S. homes for one year.



Furthermore, the amount of renewable energy generated by these 18 projects will help in avoiding about 13.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



The power generated by these projects will be supplied to Amazon’s corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers.



Comments



The Vice-President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, Kara Hurst, said, “Significant investments in renewable energy globally are an important step in delivering on The Climate Pledge, our commitment to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.”



The CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), Miranda Ballentine, said, “For the second year in a row, Amazon has set new records as it works toward fully powering its operations with renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. Large-scale clean energy investments like these benefit us all and should be the new normal for industries of all shapes and sizes.”



The Impact Director at RE-Source, Hannah Hunt, said, “The company’s 10 new renewable energy operations across Europe will benefit communities, bring new green jobs, and help meet our commitments to curb the climate crisis.”



Wall Street’s Take



On November 30, Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Brian Nowak reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $4,000 (14.1% upside potential).



Following the company’s announcement that it expects to be the largest package delivery carrier in the U.S. latest by early 2022, the analyst said, “Many investors and industry observers believed that this was potentially years away but with Amazon Logistics soon likely to be the largest player in the U.S. (with more growth to come), it should have enough capacity to start moving 3P boxes if Amazon so chooses.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon.com price target of $4,095 implies 16.8% upside potential. Shares have gained 10.1% year-to-date.



Website Traffic



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance.



According to the tool, compared to the previous year, the company’s website traffic registered a 30.6% decrease in global visits in October. Moreover, the website traffic has declined 2.4% year-to-date against the same period last year.

12147,"Despite the ongoing shift towards the digital economy, 2021 has proven to be a challenging year for PayPal (PYPL).



Shares of this financial technology company are down about 21% on a year-to-date basis compared to 22.4% growth in the Nasdaq composite index. 



PayPal’s underperformance stems from tough year-over-year comparisons, eBay’s (EBAY) payment migration, and management’s cautious outlook. PayPal’s management expects tight labor market and retail supply chain disruptions to negatively impact holiday sales and its financial performance.  



Now What?



While PayPal stock underperformed the market averages this year, could 2022 change its course?



UBS analyst Rayna Kumar initiated coverage on PayPal stock with a bullish outlook. She stated that the recent selloff in PayPal stock represents an opportunity to buy. 



It’s worth noting that PayPal struck a deal with Amazon (AMZN) that would enable American consumers to shop on Amazon with PayPal’s Venmo account. In response to the deal, PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, stated that Amazon’s large market share will significantly boost “the addressable market for Pay with Venmo.” 



He added that “Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward.”



Besides the Amazon deal, the acquisition of Paidy and the rapid adoption of PayPal’s BNPL (buy now pay later) offering bodes well for future growth. PayPal stated that since the launch of its BNPL offerings, it has processed $5.4 billion in TPV (total payment volume). Meanwhile, PayPal plans to expand its global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022.



Further, PayPal stock has positive indicators from insiders and investors. TipRanks’ insider trading activity tool shows that insiders bought $2.3 million worth of its shares in the past three months. Meanwhile, about 10.5% of investors who hold portfolios on TipRanks have raised their exposure to PayPal stock in the last 30 days.



Wall Street’s Take



Wall Street analysts continue to show confidence in PayPal stock. On TipRanks, PayPal sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average PayPal price target of $276.04 implies 49.3% upside potential to current levels.



Moreover, PayPal stock scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score system, indicating that it could outperform market averages.

New and Timely Medicine Delivery



AWS’s machine learning and analytics, together with its healthcare and life sciences experts and partners, will enable Gilead’s scientists to make data-driven decisions. These decisions will improve Gilead’s drug pipeline by giving insights across a series of data, from biomarker discovery through manufacturing and clinical trial recruitment.



AWS for Health provides easy accessibility that accelerates an organization’s innovation, unlocks the potential of health data, and develops personalized solutions for therapeutic care across 16 critical solution areas in healthcare, genomics, and biopharma.



With AWS onboard, Gilead’s research and development team will be able to strengthen their innovation and make informed decisions with valuable insights. Gilead’s focus is on improving priority areas such as clinical program and study design, patient experience, and centralized statistical adaptive monitoring, which helps Gilead quickly identify and address potential issues related to the management of clinical trials.



Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)



AWS will also help in transforming Gilead’s workloads for its ERP project to implement SAP S/4HANA throughout the organization. The implementation will enhance important processes including supply chain, finance, operations, and commercial sales across all therapeutic areas and business units.



Furthermore, through the AWS cloud, Gilead will be able to shorten its hardware refresh cycles, increase testing and speed of delivery, and enable improved business planning. Similarly, Gilead will be able to run its ERP system more efficiently by using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance types.



Management Comments



Senior VP of Sales and Marketing at AWS, Matt Garman, said, “By streamlining their IT operations with AWS and taking advantage of our AWS for Health offerings, Gilead has the ability to continuously refine its approach to clinical trials, drug development, manufacturing, and distribution.”



Senior VP and Chief Information Officer at Gilead, Marc Berson, said, “With AWS as our preferred cloud provider, our researchers can use AWS’s portfolio of services to gain the insights, agility, and security needed to deliver new medicines at speed, and treat the individual according to their unique needs, not just the disease.”

The construction of the fulfillment center will also align with the United Arab Emirates UAE ambitions to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)



Analyst Rating



Last week, Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon with a $4,300 price target, implying 22.73% upside potential to current levels. The analyst remains bullish as the e-commerce giant enters fiscal 2022. He expects online channel share gains to reaccelerate early next year, after months of declines.



Sigman also expects normalizing consumer spending growth to be good for stocks. The analyst expects a significant positive inflection on Amazon in early 2022, compared to moderating sales and merging trends in the recent past.



Consensus Rating 



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy, based on 31 Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,095 implies 16.88% upside potential to current levels.

12369,"Amazon (AMZN) is a company that requires no introduction. A behemoth in the e-commerce and cloud computing industry, Amazon also offers digital streaming and AI solutions. However, Amazon’s performance of late is indeed raising some eyebrows. 



I remain bullish on Amazon stock, and see this company as a winner in the long-term race for e-commerce supremacy. Let's dive into what's been driving the price action with this behemoth of late. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Lacklustre Q3



Amazon's stock chart over the long-term is impressive. However, this company certainly hasn't proved to be volatility-free over the years.



Amazon's valuation has remained higher than most of its large-cap peers for some time. The company's growth trajectory has allowed for this valuation gap. 



Earnings reports tend to provide volatility for most stocks. However, companies like Amazon can see more volatility during earnings season than other stocks. Such was the case this past quarter.



Late last month, Amazon reported earnings that didn't give investors the jolt they hoped for. To be fair, AMZN stock rallied into earnings. Accordingly, a significant amount of exuberance was priced into this report.



Net earnings came in at $6.2 billion for the quarter, which was actually a drop from last year's $6.3 billion tally. Given that 2020 was a pandemic year, that's a pretty high baseline to go off of. However, any sort of drop in profitability is likely to be viewed negatively, particularly for a company of Amazon's ilk.



These results also suggested to investors that fears that the economic reopening may hinder earnings are real. How many quarters this weakness persists remains to be seen. It should be noted that the company did report revenue growth of 15%. However, this growth rate was down from the 16% rate reported last year.



Shortages in labor supply, tightness in the global supply chain, and rising costs across the board could impact margins over the near term. The market appears to be pricing in this risk. 



However, long-term investors quickly snapped up AMZN shares over the past month, bringing this stock to within 10% of its all-time high. Amazon isn't a stock that's likely to remain depressed for long. At least, that's what the market appears to be telling us.



AWS Shines



One of the key bright spots in an earnings report that most have called lackluster, was Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounts for the e-commerce behemoth's fast-growing Cloud segment. 



This segment brought in Q3 revenues of more than $16 billion. That was good for a 39% year-over-year increase, and a 29% quarter-over-quarter rise. 



Operating margins in this segment came in at around 30%. For Amazon, that's high. Investors looking for a profit driver in the quarters to come are increasingly looking at AWS to make up the difference from margin contraction resulting from supply chain issues.



AWS is Amazon's golden child right now. This is the segment true long-term investors will want to keep an eye on, as Amazon navigates its way through a difficult competitive environment.



Retention Policies, Staff Recruiting



With multiple headwinds, as discussed earlier, Amazon’s tactical move to combat these forces is indeed laudable. The company is making heavy investments in its staff recruiting, through expensive retention policies like free college tuition fees, increased salaries, etc., for its employees.



These moves have affected Amazon’s Q3 earnings. Some investors may not like any company paying its workers more. However, there's a strong argument to be made that Amazon is investing in its human infrastructure to be able to continuously grow. 



According to a number of experts on this matter, these steps will be essential to maintain a positive customer experience and manage shopper expectations. Arguably, these strategic investments will ultimately help Amazon grow its manpower along with its morale.



New VTR Policy



Recently, Amazon sent a notice to third-party merchants that they need to maintain a VTR (valid tracking rate) for at least 95% of their products. Inability to do can result in getting delisted from the platform. On the company's webpage, it was reported this was only applicable to merchants in China. However, several businesses in Canada were affected as well. 



This mass suspension wiped out a significant proportion of AMZN’s sales. Further, many customers also refused to buy from merchants as the shipping charges were higher.



These negative catalysts appear to be priced in, and Amazon is working on ways of resolving this issue. Over the longer term, it's more likely that Amazon will find a way to lead the way in product tracking, while also investing in its suppliers to make this happen. However, the headlines certainly haven't been good for Amazon lately.



What's Next?



Amazon is lining up to open its department stores, indicating its expansion into the brick-and-mortar category. The stores will come with a high-tech dressing rooms, assisted with touchscreens. Customers will have access to over 100 private-label offerings at the touch of their fingerprints.



The e-commerce giant is also expanding its grocery service business, growing the number of its locations rapidly to bolster both online and offline sales. This will also help Amazon to mitigate supply chain issues – a major factor in increasing prices.



In the next 12 months, Amazon is looking to rake in around $150 million in Economic Operating Cash Flow (EBITDAR). The company the hopes to boost its investments in technology and infrastructure, along with making strategic acquisitions and expanding its retail stores in the coming years.



Wall Street's Take



As per TipRanks' analyst rating consensus, AMZN stock is a Strong Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 31 Buy recommendations.



The stock has a median price target of $4,095. Amazon's price targets range from a high of $4,500 to a low of $3,800 per share.







Bottom Line



Amazon’s Q4 guidance does not seemingly provide much in the way for investors to be bullish on this stock. However, taking the longer-term view of Amazon, it's hard to argue against this company's growth prospects.



As we head into what could be a blockbuster holiday shopping season, all eyes will be on how this e-commerce juggernaut performs this quarter.

12379,"‘Black Friday’, the busiest day of the year for e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has grabbed the attention of a climate activist group called Extinction Rebellion (XR) in Britain. 



As part of an international protest against the global retail giant, the group has blocked 15 Amazon depots in the U.K., the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands.



According to Reuters, XR said that ‘Black Friday’ symbolizes “an obsession with overconsumption that is not consistent with a liveable planet.” The group also said that giant retailers like Amazon leverage consumers' desire for convenience for their own benefits by spoiling the balance in the natural ecosystem.



The activists held banners that read, “Black Fridays exploits people and planet”, “Amazon crime” and “Infinite growth, finite planet.”



In Britain, XR’s demonstrations started at about 4 am with 20 activists at the distribution center in Dunfermline, Fife. The activists stopped lorries from entering and leaving the facility but did not block employees (night shift) from leaving.



Another spokesperson for XR said, “Amazon continues to lobby the US government to fight against climate legislation while telling the public they are committed to green initiatives… They are committing the very definition of greenwash.”



The group said that it aims to reveal Amazon’s unethical business practices, which exploit customers as well as workers’ rights in the name of company profits, and also wishes to expose the wastefulness of the ‘Black Friday’.



Target Price



With 31 unanimous Buys, the AMZN stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Amazon price target of $4,095 implies 14.37% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 12.1% over the past year.

Website Traffic



TipRanks’ Website Traffic tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into AMZN’s performance.



In October, Amazon website traffic recorded a 30.64% year-over-year decline in monthly visits. Similarly, year-to-date website traffic growth decreased 2.39% compared to the same period last year.

12489,"The retail season is poised to be in full swing, given the upcoming holidays. The National Retail Federation (NRF) is optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.



According to the NRF’s estimate, holiday sales in the month of November and December are likely to increase year-over-year between 8.5% and 10.5% and be worth $843.4 billion and $859 billion, respectively.



Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, let us look at how two biggies in the retail space, Amazon and Alibaba, stack up before the holiday season begins and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Amazon (AMZN)



The fourth quarter is seasonally a strong quarter for Amazon. The company will offer “more Black Friday deals than ever before” at its Black Friday event starting on November 25 and lasting through November 26.



However, the company is also facing multiple difficulties in Q4, including rising wage costs, global supply chain constraints, a shortage in labor supply, and an uptick in freight and shipping costs.



Considering these headwinds, Amazon announced last week that it was raising its referral and Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) fees in the United States starting from next year. The company stated in its press release, “…costs are rising and we now need to make adjustments to next year’s fee structure in response. In 2022, we will adjust FBA fulfillment fees to partially offset the higher permanent operating costs we face going forward.”



Amazon also mentioned in its press release that since the pandemic started, it had invested over $15 billion to double its fulfillment capacity in the United States, ramped up the average starting wage in the United States to $18 per hour, and hired around 628,000 people.



Indeed, the company had stated on its Q3 earnings call that it expects its operating costs to double from $2 billion in Q3 to $4 billion in Q4, while net sales are likely to take a hit of around 60 basis points due to foreign exchange fluctuations.



In Q4, AMZN anticipates net sales to be between $130 billion and $140 billion. In contrast, Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman expects net sales to grow 9.4% year-over-year to $137.4 billion against consensus estimates of $137.8 billion. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



The analyst, while bullish on the stock, maintains that “both sales and margin momentum have moderated for AMZN in 2H21, which has also pressured the stock (it has bounced recently but still toward its low in relative valuation terms).”



Sigman added that while the sales issue is due to a difficult comparison to its sales a year back and a “tight product supply” amid rebounding traffic at retail stores, margins are under pressure from higher operating costs.



But will Amazon recover from these headwinds? Yes, is the analyst’s answer. Sigman expects that by the middle of next year, “AMZN’s market share gains [will] reaccelerate,” driven by normalization of retail traffic recovery early next year.



Another key driver could be the company’s capacity build out, which  ""should support incremental sales and operating leverage through FY22” as well as its improving product supply.



More importantly, analyst Sigman feels that the stock currently “reflects the cyclical risks (which are real and factored into our model), but not the structural positives, including the changes in consumer behavior from the pandemic, growth in its customer base, and potential for share gains to accelerate through FY22/FY23 as it expands its faster fulfillment options.”



As a result, the analyst is of the opinion that AMZN is “one of the best investment opportunities based on potential acceleration in sales/EBITDA vs. current trends and valuation upside.”



Sigman has a Buy rating and a price target of $4,300 (20.4% upside) on the stock.



The rest of the Street sides with Sigman with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating with 31 Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,095 implies 14.6% upside potential to current levels.







Alibaba (BABA)



Alibaba’s regulatory woes continued this week, as it had a run-in with Chinese regulators, who fined the company. According to a Global Times report, the Chinese regulator, State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) slapped a fine of $78,300 each on major Chinese companies including Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), and JD.com (JD).



The fine was due to a violation of China’s “anti-monopoly rules in 34 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals which they [Alibaba] failed to declare,"" according to the report.



This news and the worse-than-expected Q3 results resulted in the stock plunging approximately 18% in the past five days.



Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee also perceives regulatory risk as a key risk factor for the stock. Indeed, according to the TipRanks Risk Analysis tool, BABA is at a higher legal and regulatory risk of 26.4%, as compared to the sector average of 16.8%.



In the fiscal second quarter, while Alibaba’s revenues soared 29% year-over-year to $31.15 billion, they still fell short of consensus estimates of $32.1 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings came in at $1.74 per American Depository Share (ADS), a fall of 38% year-over-year, missing the consensus estimate of $1.93.



When it comes to Customer Management Revenues (CMR), it went up by only 3% year-over-year to $11.13 billion, primarily “due to single-digit physical goods GMV [gross merchandise value] growth that resulted from slowing market conditions and more players in the China e-commerce market,"" according to the company's press release.



CMR revenues made up 36% of BABA’s total revenues in fiscal Q2. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)



Analyst Lee expects “CMR to grow less than GMV growth as opposed to higher in FY21, as BABA continues to provide lower commissions to merchants as part of its retention initiatives.”



Going forward, the analyst anticipates CMR revenues to grow in “single-digits for the next few quarters.”



This negative aside, Lee noted other positives for the stock, including strength in cloud and international revenues, and new investments in Community Group Buying (CGB) and Taobao Deals.



In fiscal Q2, Taobao Deals saw 240 million active buyers while according to Lee, CGB saw GMV rise 250% quarter-on-quarter. Taobao Deals offers value-for-money products for price-conscious consumers.



As a result, Lee noted, that despite macro headwinds, “the company plans to continue to invest in lower-tier markets using a multi-app strategy while defending its core market share.”



The analyst remained bullish on the stock, with a Buy rating, but lowered the price target from $245 to $215 (57.4% upside) on the stock.



Other analysts on Wall Street echo Lee’s view and remain bullish with a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock, based on 20 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Alibaba price target of $216.10 implies 58.2% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



While analysts remain bullish about both stocks, both e-commerce giants are battling on different fronts. AMZN is facing rising operating costs that could pressure its margins over the near term.



In contrast, Alibaba is facing macro headwinds and increasing regulatory scrutiny. 



It remains to be seen how these two companies will ride these challenges. However, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Alibaba does seem to be a better Buy.

12580,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) company, has been selected as the preferred cloud provider for SAP workloads by adidas AG, one of the largest sports brands in the world. 



With the implementation of the modern SAP S/4HANA platform, adidas will migrate its SAP environment to AWS. The move will facilitate adidas to digitize its value chain to provide enhanced consumer experiences, become a more data-driven business, and support new business models, including direct-to-consumer. 



Benefits of AWS 



The integration of adidas’ SAP S/4HANA with AWS technologies is likely to enable advanced analytics capabilities, data science, and enterprise reporting. Additionally, by recording cloud-based data on AWS, adidas will have more visibility across its internal and consumer-facing operations to deliver new business and consumer insights.  



Also, AWS’ service Amazon SageMaker is expected to help the company's e-commerce site to cater to individual consumer’s style preferences to deepen brand loyalty and maximize satisfaction. Furthermore, high-performance computing on AWS is likely to incorporate consumer feedback at the early stages of the product creation process.  



Official Comments 



The VP of Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS, Greg Pearson, said, “We are seeing a fundamental change in how consumer goods companies run their technology infrastructures. adidas joins the thousands of customers that run SAP on AWS, leveraging AWS’s reliable and scalable global infrastructure and unmatched SAP experience to provide key insights, drive innovation, and support the creation of new products and services.” 



“We look forward to working with adidas on its SAP and digital transformation strategies that will help speed the introduction of new cloud-based customer experiences like its mobile app, tailored shopping, and personalized offers that deepen the consumer relationship,” Pearson added. 



Wall Street’s Take 



On November 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN with a price target of $4,000 (8.8% upside potential).  



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,088.17 implies 11.2% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 18.7% over the past year. 



Website Traffic 



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance. 



According to the tool, the Amazon website recorded a 30.64% monthly decline, year-over-year, in global visits in October. Moreover, year-to-date website growth, compared to year-to-date website growth in the previous year, came in at a decline of 2.39%.

The new location in New York City will serve drinks and cover the rest of Starbucks' menu, as well as a curated assortment of food and beverages in the Amazon Go market, including freshly prepared salads, sandwiches, bakery items, and other snacks options. The store will maintain the same staffing level as any other Starbucks store.



The new store will also have a modernized lounge, including individual workspaces and expanded tables with power outlets and USB ports.



Customers can place an order on the Starbucks app before arriving at the store. Upon arrival, they can check the status of their order on a digital screen and then grab their order directly from a Starbucks barista.



Customers have the option to use a credit card, Amazon Shopping app, or Amazon One palm reader to shop at the Amazon Go market, similar to any other Amazon Go store. They can use Amazon Go’s Just Walk Out technology for a smooth checkout experience.



Together, both companies plan to open 2 more stores in the U.S in 2022.



Management Weighs In



Katie Young, SVP of global growth and development at Starbucks, said, “Our goal with this new store concept is to give our customers the ability to choose which experience is right for them as they go through their day, whether it is utilizing the Starbucks and Amazon apps to purchase food and beverages on the go, or deciding to stay in the lounge for the traditional third place experience Starbucks is known for.”



Dilip Kumar, VP of physical retail and technology at Amazon, said, “Customers have enjoyed the effortless shopping experience enabled by our Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go where they can simply come in, grab something delicious to eat or drink, and just leave and carry on with their day without having to wait in line to pay.”



Wall Street’s Take



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and 8 Holds. The average Starbucks price target of $124.24 implies that the stock has upside potential of 11.6% from current levels.



Starbucks scores an 8 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Shares have gained about 15% over the past year.

Amazon is an American multinational technology company founded by Jeff Bezos. The company has four business divisions: Ecommerce, Digital Streaming, Cloud Computing, and AI, and is one of the Big Five companies in the American technology industry. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Strengths



Amazon is the provider of the largest online marketplace in the world. The company is one of the most influential economic forces in the world, and is arguably the most valuable brand in the world, worth over $1 trillion. 



It is known for disrupting well-established industries through combining mass scale and rapidly innovating with technology. The company is the second-biggest private employer in the U.S.



In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, thereby significantly increasing its footprint as a bricks-and-mortar retailer. It has also made additional acquisitions over the years, including Twitch, IMDb, Ring, and Zoox. It is currently in the process of purchasing leading media company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.



Recent Results



Amazon reported revenue of $110.8 billion, falling short of its expected $111.81 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This is in comparison with $96.15 billion revenue in Q3 of 2020. Amazon’s overall sales saw an increase of 15% year-over-year, reflecting a slowdown from the previous quarter’s growth rate (27%). However, the company was still able to achieve revenue over $100 billion for its fourth consecutive quarter.



The company’s earnings were reported at $6.12 per share as compared to the expected $8.96, and the $12.30 EPS from the same quarter of the previous year.



Amazon’s major online stores reported lower-than-expected sales in the third quarter of 2021, contributing to the slowdown of the company’s overall revenue. In addition, e-commerce sales showed an increase of 3% to $49.94 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2020, missing estimates by $51.53 billion.



The company’s result did get a boost from its Web Services cloud computing platform that saw a significant growth of 39% and reached $16.1 billion. This high-margin division has been outpacing Amazon’s Ecommerce unit. In addition, revenue from Amazon’s other business unit, which predominantly comprises advertising sales, increased by 49% over the last year, keeping in line with the rate in the third quarter of 2020.



In the fourth quarter, Amazon expects to see $140 billion of net sales, which is lower than the $142 billion consensus estimate. The company also reported operating income between breakeven and $3 billion, coming quite short of the $7.2 billion consensus estimate.



Valuation Metrics



Amazon’s stock looks reasonably valued right now as its EV to forward EBITDA ratio is 23.8x compared to its five-year average of 23x and its Price to forward Normalized Earnings ratio is 87.69x compared to its five-year average of 101.1x. 



Given the company’s competitive advantages, proven track record of innovation, and expectations for 22.1% EBITDA growth in 2021 and 23.6% EBITDA growth in 2022, this valuation looks reasonable.



Wall Street’s Take



From Wall Street analysts, Amazon earns a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 30 unanimous Buy ratings. Additionally, the average Amazon price target of $4,088.17 puts the upside potential at 10.6%.







Summary and Conclusions



Amazon is one of the most dominant companies in the world, and continues to leverage its formidable competitive advantages to drive new avenues of growth. 



While the stock does not look dirt cheap here, Wall Street analysts’ unanimous bullishness on the stock and its reasonable valuation multiples make it look promising.

12720,"‘Tis the holiday season but whether it will be the most wonderful time of the year for the retail sector in the United States remains to be seen. 



The National Retail Federation (NRF) remains upbeat about the holiday season and expects that holiday sales in the month of November and December are likely to be worth $843.4 billion and $859 billion, respectively, with growth rates of between 8.5% and 10.5%, compared to 2020.



Let us look at where the major retail players stand before the start of the holiday season even as inflation is rising, and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks, using the TipRanks stock comparison tool.







Amazon (AMZN)



For e-commerce giant Amazon, the fourth quarter is usually a strong quarter ahead of the holiday season. The company’s 48-hour Black Friday event is set to kick off this month, beginning on November 25 and lasting  through November 26.  The event will see Amazon offering some deep-discount deals on big-ticket purchases like electronic appliances and gadgets.



But while the company will be offering “more Black Friday deals than ever before,” as the company's press release proclaimed, it will be also wading through multiple problems in Q4. Difficulties include rising wage costs, global supply chain constraints, shortage in labor supply, and an uptick in freight and shipping costs.



These issues are expected to weigh down on its Consumer business. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)



Amazon’s management elaborated more on these issues at its Q3 earnings call. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, pointed out that while the company is increasing its headcount in the U.S., this has unfortunately coincided with a shortage of available workers, especially in the U.S., leading to rising wages. As a result, Amazon anticipates operating costs to double from $2 billion in Q3 to $4 billion in Q4.



What’s more, in Q4, AMZN expects its net sales to take a hit of around 60 basis points due to foreign exchange fluctuations. Net sales are therefore expected to range between $130 billion and $140 billion. Operating income is projected to break even or go up to $3 billion.



Bank of America analyst Justin Post pegged the Q4 outlook as “disappointing” and anticipates that it will take “a few quarters to optimize costs for new fulfilment centers, higher labor costs, and increasing 1-Day shipping capabilities, but anticipate a big margin snap back in 2023.”



However, the analyst remained bullish on the stock with a Buy rating, citing BAC card data that indicated that AMZN continues to gain online market share and strength in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment.



Post has a price target of $4,250 (19.9% upside) on the stock.



Indeed, a look at the website traffic volume data for Amazon.com using the TipRanks Website Traffic tool indicates that unique visitors on all devices are up 7.7% year-to-date. The data provided by SEMRush Holdings (SEMR) further shows that monthly unique visitors are inching upwards by 0.8% month-over-month and totaled 666.7 million in October.







Target (TGT)



Rising inflation weighed on Target’s investors’ minds, too, as they didn’t seem to cheer the retail giant’s impressive Q3 results. The stock dropped 4.7% in yesterday’s trading, following the announcement of its third-quarter results.



Inflationary pressures, including higher freight and inventory costs, dragged down Target’s gross margin rate of 28% in Q3, a drop of 2.6% from the same period a year back.



However, the company’s third-quarter revenues increased 13.3% year-over-year to $25.7 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $24.8 billion. (See Top Smart Score stocks on TipRanks)



Adjusted earnings came in at $3.03 per share, up 8.7% year-over-year and surpassing the Street’s estimate of $2.83 per share.



As the holiday season approaches, in Q4, Target anticipates “high-single digit to low-double digit growth in comparable sales,” according to its press release.



While Michael Fiddelke, Target’s CFO, admitted on its earnings call that it was difficult to ascertain whether the current inflationary pressures were temporary or structural, he was optimistic that “supply chain bottlenecks should ease over time.”



Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO of Target, commented on these cost headwinds, saying, “As our team face these cost increases, they maintained a guest-first approach and a focus on value while managing overall profitability as well.”



When it comes to inventory, Target was well-positioned as at the end of Q3, “inventory on the balance sheet was more than $2 billion higher than last year, representing growth of about 18% from a year ago,"" according to John Mulligan, COO. 



While investors remain concerned about inflation, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul has a different take. The analyst remained encouraged “by the ongoing strength of Target’s business, its profitability, and cash flow generation.”



The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $295 (16.2% upside) on the stock.



Wall Street analysts side with Drbul and are bullish, with a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 12 Buys and 4 Holds. The average Target price target of $286.79 implies 13% upside potential to current levels.







Walmart (WMT)



Investors do not seem to be impressed with WMT’s strong Q3 results, as the stock slid 4.4% post its earnings.



In Q3 FY22, the omnichannel retailer posted revenues of $140.5 billion, an increase of 4.3% year-over-year, surpassing consensus estimates of $135.6 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.45 per share, beating consensus estimates of $1.40.



Ahead of the holiday season, in fiscal Q4, Walmart anticipates comparable sales of approximately 5%. Its inventory is well-stocked and is up by 11.5%. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



Inflation has been a concern for the retail sector and WMT was no exception, as in Q3 it led to rising supply chain costs and dragged down the gross profit rate for Walmart U.S. by 12 basis points.



C. Douglas McMillon, President, CEO, and Director of Walmart admitted on its earnings call that while WMT had not “seen this kind of inflation in the US for quite some time,"" the company would still want to keep its prices low.



Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul approves this price leadership strategy “in this very dynamic environment” and added that it “is executing its strategy well as demonstrated by its sales performance and EPS upside, despite gross margin declines.”



The analyst was also positive about WMT’s alternate revenue streams including Advertising, Spark Last-Mile Delivery, and eCommerce Marketplace. As a result, Drbul is bullish about the stock, with a Buy rating and a price target of $185 with around 30% upside.



The rest of the Street, however, is cautiously optimistic, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Walmart price target of $170.95 implies 20.4% upside potential to current levels.







Shopify (SHOP)



Shopify is a provider of essential Internet infrastructure for e-commerce that offers services through subscriptions and merchant solutions. The stock has soared 9.9% in the past five days, bolstered by its exceptional Q3 results.



Its total revenues soared 46% year-over-year to $1,123.7 million, while adjusted earnings came in at $0.81 per diluted share versus $1.13 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.



Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) rose 35% year-over-year to $41.8 billion, while cumulative GMV was $400 billion, doubling from $200 billion in just 16 months.



Amy Shapero, Shopify’s CFO, added on its earnings call that it was difficult to ascertain whether supply chain issues or rising costs had any impact on GMV. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



When it comes to its Q4 outlook, Shapero stated, “We continue to expect the fourth quarter to contribute the largest share of full-year revenue and that the revenue spread will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters than it has been historically.”



Elaborating further, Shapero added, “While the commerce market, both online and offline, may be impacted by supply chain delays or increased costs for materials, labor, shipping or advertising in the fourth quarter…we expect our GMV in the fourth quarter to continue to grow substantially faster than the commerce market.”



Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz seems to echo this view, saying, “US commerce mix of retail will dip roughly -40 bps [basis points] this year, down from 19% in CY20; however, Shopify will still gain +220 bps penetration of US ecommerce, vs. +330 bps in CY20, by our estimates.”



Moreover, the analyst was “most bullish on significant greenfield paths” like Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) and Shopify Pay Installments (SPI). Zgutowicz anticipates that SFN will make up around 20% of the company’s revenue exiting 2023.



As a result, Zgutowicz remained upbeat, with a Buy rating and a price target of $2000 (22.1% upside) on the stock.



Other analysts on Wall Street are cautiously optimistic, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 9 Holds. The average Shopify price target of $1,671.81 implies 2.1% upside potential to current levels.

12744,"According to a report published by Reuters, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) plans to stop accepting credit cards issued by Visa, Inc. (V) in the U.K., starting next year, due to high transaction fees.



Meanwhile, Amazon customers in the U.K. can continue to use Visa debit cards, American Express (AXP) and Mastercard (MA) credit cards, and Eurocard.



Company Reaction



An Amazon spokesperson said, “As a result of Visa's continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept U.K.-issued Visa credit cards as of January 19, 2022.”



A Visa spokesperson said, “We are very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”



Market Reaction



Following Amazon’s announcement, the U.K. Trade Commission has called on the government to improve the trade agreement between the U.K. and the European Union (EU).



Furthermore, analysts have called on the U.K. regulators to look into credit card fees. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



During Brexit, the EU had imposed a cap on credit card fees charged by issuers. However, this cap is not in place in the U.K.



Tamara Cincik from the U.K. Trade and Business Commission, said, “If Amazon can't make it work, with all their resources and ability to navigate legislation to avoid costs, then small businesses have no chance and so the government must improve the U.K.-EU trade and cooperation agreement to keep British businesses competitive.”



Wall Street’s Take on Amazon



Recently, Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet maintained a Buy rating on Amazon but lowered the price target to $4,100 from $4,175 (15.5% upside potential) to reflect the third-quarter results.



However, Bazinet thinks there is a lot of scope for growth in the company’s business-to-business services.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon.com price target of $4,088.17 implies 15.2% upside potential. Shares have gained 14.3% over the past year.



Website Traffic of Amazon



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance.



According to the tool, the company’s website traffic registered a 30.64% decrease in global visits in October. Moreover, website traffic has declined 2.4% year-to-date.







Wall Street’s Take on Visa



On November 1, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev assigned a Buy rating to Visa and reduced the price target from $275 to $255 (24.4% upside potential).



Dolev said, “The expected dollar value of incentives in FY22 of ~$10bn is roughly in line with their normal trajectory had COVID not happened. In other words, while the % appears elevated, this is a reflection of management's low travel CXB volume assumptions, which we believe is very conservative given the pace of border reopening.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 unanimous Buys. The average Visa price target of $276.77 implies nearly 35% upside potential. Shares have lost 9.1% over the past six months.



Website Traffic of Visa



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Visa’s performance.



According to the tool, the company’s website traffic registered a 20.72% decrease in global visits in October. Moreover, the website traffic has declined 5.3% year-to-date.

Implications of the Collaboration



According to the terms of the agreement, IBM’s Open Data for Industries, IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and the AWS Cloud will be integrated to benefit the energy industry. (See Amazon stock charts on TipRanks)



The combination will help reduce data barriers for the energy companies and reduce the cost, time, and resources required to streamline their operations, further enabling a smooth transition to sustainable energy options.



Management Weighs In



Bill Vass, VP of Engineering at AWS, commented, “Much of the data needed to solve the complex energy challenges, such as superior subsurface decisions, already exists, yet is untapped. This is because one of the greatest values of that data is derived when it can be effectively combined, but usually this data is locked by data residency requirements, legacy applications or proprietary data formats.”



He added, “By collaborating with IBM and leveraging Red Hat OpenShift, we will be able to offer customers a global, seamless offering with the flexibility to run on virtually any IT infrastructure and drive longer-term digital innovation.”



See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>



Wall Street’s Take



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,088.17 implies 15.3% upside potential to current levels.



AMZN scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Shares of Amazon have underperformed in 2021, with gains of about 7% compared to gains of 24% for the S&P 500 (SPY). I am bearish on AMZN stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks).



I am worried that there are two major problems that this e-commerce giant needs to overcome, and it will not be easy to do so. I refer to a slowdown in revenue growth and profitability. 



On its website, Amazon informs us about its core principles as a business: “Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.”



I argue that the focus on customer obsession and neglecting the competitors may become the Achilles' heel for Amazon.



COVID-19 Boosted Its Financial Performance: What's Next?



The historic crash for the U.S. stock market in March 2020, when shares of Amazon fell to $1785 per share, created an investment opportunity for the bold investors who believed in the long-term future of this e-commerce giant. 



Today, the stock price is hovering near $3500, representing gains of nearly 100%. For a company that is so large and mature such as Amazon, this return is phenomenal. However, it has pushed through to my analysis that its shares are overpriced now.



Amid pandemic-related lockdowns, 2020 was a great year of strong financial performance for Amazon. ""Stay-at-home"" stocks reached all-time highs as consumers shifted to online shopping and use of the Internet to spend their time and fill their buying needs. 



Amazon's revenue in 2020 increased 37.6%, reaching $386.1 billion. Its EPS (diluted) increased 81.9%, reaching $41.83. What can the return to normality, even with COVID-19 still present, bring for Amazon in 2021 and beyond?



Third Quarter 2021 Results: A Miss after Five Consecutive Beats



Starting in Q2 2020, Amazon had a remarkable series of five consecutive quarters of its earnings per share (EPS) beating estimates. 



For most of 2020, this strong EPS trend was attributed to the behavior of consumers amid the pandemic. The first half of 2021 was also a strong year of financial performance, as Amazon delivered better than expected EPS in both Q1 and Q2. Q3 2021 was a different story though.



The estimate for Q3 2021 EPS was $8.90, and the actual number was $6.12. In Q1 2021, Amazon reached its highest level of EPS, with a figure of $15.79 reported. Ever since, EPS has been trending down, presenting the obvious questions: has Amazon witnessed a peak in its EPS? Is a slowdown already present?



On October 28, 2021, upon the release of the financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2021, Amazon mentioned some key highlights.



First operating cash flow, free cash flow, operating income, and net income have all decreased in the third quarter. Especially net income, which “decreased to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, or $6.12 per diluted share, compared with $6.3 billion, or $12.37 per diluted share, in third quarter 2020.”



Revenue Growth: A Slowdown Is Evident



Quarterly sales growth for Amazon has been anemic in 2021. Q4 2020 showed a spike in its revenue growth of 30.6% to $125.6 billion. In Q1 2021, revenue reported was $108.5 billion, a decline of 13.6% from Q4 2020. In Q2, there was an increase of 4.2% to $113.1 billion, which was followed by a 2% decline in Q3 to $110.8 billion.



Analysts' consensus revenue estimate for Fiscal Year 2021 is $470.4 billion, or an increase of 21.8% compared to 2020. However, for the Fiscal Year 2022, the average estimate for revenue is $553.7 billion, an increase of 17.7%. Analysts believe that Amazon is in the business phase of economic slowdown, after the phenomenal 2020 year.



Fourth-Quarter 2021 Guidance: Too Conservative?



The fourth quarter of 2021 is expected to be a strong one for Amazon due to online sales supported by the Christmas shopping season.



The company itself has stated that “net sales are expected to be between $130 billion and $140 billion or to grow between 4% and 12% compared with fourth-quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $3 billion, compared with $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.”



As it seems, Amazon also believes an economic slowdown in its operating income is present.



Legal Settlements: Another Risk?



Amazon is seeking to settle EU antitrust investigations. If a fine is imposed, revenue and profitability will take a hit, even if it's a one-time event. Amazon's valuation is also worrisome today.



Its forward P/E ratio is 85.7, representing a ~390% difference from the sector median figure of 17.5. Its forward price-to-sales ratio of 3.8 represents a 187% difference from the sector median figure of 1.3. 



Can this premium for Amazon be in jeopardy if revenue and EPS growth decline due to operating expenses, global supply chain issues, and labor shortages? I believe the answer is affirmative.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 30 unanimous Buy ratings.



The average Amazon price target of $4,088.17 implies 17% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a high of $4,500 to a low of $3,800.

13055,"Walmart (WMT), a multinational omnichannel retailer, will report its third-quarter 2021 earnings on November 16.



Walmart's online presence has grown dramatically in tandem with its already robust offline retail network as a result of increased digitization. WMT's e-commerce sales in the United States increased by 6% year-over-year and by 103% over a two-year period in Q2. Even Walmart CEO Doug McMillon expressed optimism about the company's e-commerce growth on the Q2 conference call.



Here, we have utilized TipRanks’ Website Traffic tool to evaluate Walmart's internet traffic and obtain a better picture of the company's e-commerce operations ahead of the Q3 print.



See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks >>



Web Traffic Details



During the third quarter, we saw that total unique visitors to the company's website from all devices dropped by almost 2.6% year-over-year to 2.3 billion. During the same time period, the stock price increased by 9.6%.



When we compare the number of unique visitors to the company's website over a year-to-date (YTD) period, the trend differs. Visitors to the company's website have climbed by 12.4% YTD.



In October, global traffic to the Walmart website reached 759.2 million, a decrease of 7% from the previous month. Increased competition from other stores, such as Amazon (AMZN), may have contributed to the drop.







Q3 Expectations



Management raised its full-year 2021 profits guidance to $6.20 – $6.35 per share on the Q2 conference call, which investors should be aware of. Meanwhile, the business expects adjusted profits of $1.30 to $1.40 per share in the third quarter.



Walmart should see robust retail sales in the upcoming quarter as the economy gains steam and the holiday season approaches. However, there are still dangers associated with pandemic-related outbreaks at the company's physical locations.



Wall Street’s Take



Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh expects the company to do well in the third quarter, and feels it is well-positioned for the Christmas season.



According to current statistics, the grocery sector is gaining pace, fueled by rising food costs, particularly in the Fresh segment, commented Parikh. He also believes that owing to Walmart's supply chain advancements, the general merchandise market will continue to thrive.



As a result, he reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $170.



Turning to the rest of the Street, Walmart stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys and 4 Holds. The average Walmart price target of $171.74 implies 15.7% upside potential from current levels.

13155,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has unveiled its plans for three new operations facilities in Alabama and launched a new fulfillment center for supporting customers across the state.  



Markedly, Amazon’s new Huntsville non-sortable fulfillment center is now open for business. Meanwhile, among the three new sites, the Birmingham delivery station is likely to be operational in November and will employ about 150 individuals. 



Additionally, the Huntsville XL fulfillment center is expected to open in 2022 and will provide more than 250 full-time jobs. Also, the Montgomery receive center, likely to open in 2022, will be an Inbound Cross Dock facility and is expected to provide more than 500 full-time jobs. 



Encouragingly, over 9,000 direct jobs statewide have been created by Amazon, and more than $1 billion was invested in Alabama in infrastructure and compensation to employees. Further, the company is on the verge to add more than 500 full-time jobs to its operation by the end of 2021. (See Amazon stock charts on TipRanks) 



Official Comments 



The VP of public policy at Amazon, Brian Huseman, said, ""We are proud to continue our investment in Alabama with thousands of good jobs and new, state-of-the-art operations facilities...We look forward to continued investment as we innovate and grow to better serve our customers across the state.""

Wall Street’s Take 



Recently, Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet maintained a Buy rating on the stock but decreased the price target to $4,100 (14.65% upside potential) from $4,175.  



Following the third-quarter results, Bazinet updated his model but continues to foresee ""ample room for growth"" in Amazon's business-to-business services. 



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 29 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,075.34 implies 14% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 17.8% over the past year. 



Website Traffic 



TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Amazon’s performance this quarter. According to the tool, the Amazon website recorded a 30.64% monthly decline, year-over-year, in global visits in October. 



Notably, year-to-date website growth, compared to year-to-date website growth in the previous year, came in at a decline of 2.39%.

13263,"Amazon's (AMZN) heavy investment in people to capitalize on rising consumer demand is a big lesson for other retailers, according to Craig Elston, Head of Strategic Services at Iterable. ""Amazon's decision making is a lesson for other retailers: deliver a positive customer experience in the face of seasonal headwinds, and you can capitalize on an increase in consumer demand,"" he says.



Amazon's businesses have been under pressure lately, as evidenced by a lackluster Q3 financial report last week. The online giant's top and bottom lines missed analyst estimates and gave lackluster guidance for Q4. 



""It should come as no surprise that Amazon's earnings are at the mercy of economic pressures. In Q3, we've seen a plateau in consumer demand, challenges in the supply chain, and the rising cost of fulfillment,"" Elston says.



I am bullish on AMZN stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Big Spending on Staff Recruitment and Retention



Meanwhile, Elston thinks that Amazon's business will soon turn around, thanks to big investments the company has made in people and a rebound in online spending in the holiday season. 



""To mitigate the effects of these forces, Amazon has invested heavily in staff recruitment, increased wages, and deployed powerful (and expensive) retention programs like free college tuition,"" Elston says. 



He continued, ""While these expenditures have impacted Q3 earnings, they will set Amazon up to succeed in Q4 and beyond; 42% of shoppers in the U.S. plan to spend more money on gifts this holiday season compared to 2020. Maintaining a positive customer experience, and managing shopper expectations requires manpower and morale — both of which were bolstered by Amazon's Q3 spending.""



Sean Turner, CTO of Swiftly, a digital loyalty platform for brick-and-mortar grocers, is on the same page, pointing to Amazon's gaining momentum in the grocery business. 



""Despite slowing earnings, Amazon is showing momentum in the grocery space,"" he says. ""The digital leader is steadily expanding its line of Fresh grocery locations to bolster sales both online and in brick-and-mortar stores, combining technology and convenience to lure customers away from their local retailer -- especially as supply chain issues cause prices to rise and consumers spending behavior to change.""



TipRanks' Smart Score



Investors have been lukewarm on Amazon's shares recently. Its shares have gained a meager 8% so far this year compared to a 25% gain of the S&P500. Investors have anticipated Amazon's challenges, choosing to stay on the sidelines rather than chase after its shares.



TipRanks' Smart Score assigns Amazon a perfect 10, citing solid and fundamental factors and increased hedge fund activity.







Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 29 Buys assigned in the past three months. The average Amazon price target of $4075.34 implies 15.8% upside potential.



Analyst price targets range from a low of $3,800.00 per share to a high of $4,500.00 per share.



That's much better than the 8% it has gained thus far this year.







Disclosure: At the time of publication, Panos Mourdoukoutas didn’t own shares of Amazon.

13545,"Large U.S. corporations, including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) (now Meta), and Tesla (TSLA), have reported their quarterly earnings. While Microsoft, Google, and Tesla zoomed past estimates, Apple, Meta, and Amazon disappointed. 



Though these companies may not have solid quarterly performance in common, they are under a lot of scrutiny due to their global operations and large scale. Further, geopolitical events, complex international laws, and economic cycles directly hurt their brand image, financials, and operating conditions. 



Thus, it is prudent to keep an eye on the evolving risk factors of these corporations, as ascertaining risks ahead of investing enhances the odds of winning in the market.



Using the TipRanks’ new and dynamic Risk Factors tool and looking at the risk distribution profile of these companies, it is clear that Apple is the only company, among the above-mentioned companies, that has added two new risks post its recent quarterly earnings.



Highlighting the increased scrutiny on the technology sector, Apple, in a recent SEC filing, stated that it is subject to “intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.” Further, this may harm its brand reputation. 



Additionally, under its Sales & Marketing sub-category, Apple stated that its failure to offer appealing digital content to its customers could negatively impact its financial and operating performances. 



It is worth noting that Apple offers a variety of digital content through its app store and subscription-based services. Further, it launched a personalized fitness service, including Apple Fitness. 



During the Q4 conference call, Apple’s CFO Luca Maestri stated that the company is seeing “increased customer engagement” for its services. Further, the paid accounts on its digital content stores marked double-digit growth and reached an all-time high during Q4 in each geographic segment. 



Noting the strong growth in its paid subscriptions, Maestri stated that Apple now has over “745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform,” up 160 million year-over-year. 



Overall, Apple’s risk distribution profile indicates that factors including its Ability to Sell, Production, and Macro & Political place it in a higher risk zone. All these risk factors are well above the sector benchmark.



However, its Legal & Regulatory, Tech & Innovation, and Finance & Corporate risks are well below the sector benchmark.  







Meanwhile, on TipRanks, Apple stock has a rating consensus of Strong Buy, based on 19 Buys and 6 Holds. Additionally, Apple scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that it will likely outperform the market.



See Top Smart Score stocks >>



The average Apple price target of $168.91 implies 12.8% upside potential to current levels.

13707,"Amazon (AMZN) delivered worse-than-expected third-quarter results and provided Q4 guidance below analyst expectations as the company anticipates higher costs. As a result, shares fell 4% in Thursday’s extended trading session.



The miss was primarily due to weaker-than-expected North American E-commerce sales growth as a result of the pandemic. Further, higher overall costs driven by labor shortages, higher wages, supply-chain challenges, and increased freight and shipping costs also led to the decline in profits. 



`Disappointingly, adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share declined 51% year-over-year and fell far short of analysts’ expectations of $8.92 per share. The company reported earnings of $12.37 per share in the prior-year period.



Furthermore, net sales rose 15% to $110.8 billion but failed to meet consensus estimates of $111.6 billion.



Amazon Reduces Q4 Outlook Based on Higher Costs



For the upcoming fourth quarter, Amazon is projecting net sales in the range of $130 - $140 billion versus the consensus estimate of $142.5 billion. The guided sales imply growth of between 4% and 12% compared to the year-ago period. Operating income is expected between $0 and $3 billion, much lower than the $6.9 billion generated in the fourth quarter last year. (See Amazon stock charts on TipRanks)



Sharing his views on the future, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy commented, “In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season.”



He further added. “It’ll be expensive for us in the short term, but it’s the right prioritization for our customers and partners.”



Wall Street’s Take



Following the quarterly results, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $4,250 on Amazon.



Sheridan stated, “We expect investors to have a muted reaction to Amazon's Q3 ’21 earnings report as key issues likely remain in terms of framing the overall online eCommerce environment and the costs needed to emphasize customers and sellers over short-term profit narratives.”



He further added, “Given the stock has underperformed (+7% vs SPX +39% in the last 12 months), we see AMZN increasingly as a compelling 12-month risk/reward from current levels of key dynamics that could drive forward share performance (capacity yielding volume as demand stabilizes, easy comps emerge and short-term holiday headwinds dissipate into 2022).”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 unanimous Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,174.30 implies 21.1% upside potential to current levels.



AMZN scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, we will compare two popular online merchandise companies, Amazon, and eBay, and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Amazon (AMZN)



Amazon is expected to announce its Q3 results on October 28. In Q3, the e-commerce giant anticipates net sales to range between $106 billion and $112 billion, representing an increase of between 10% and 16% year-over-year.



Operating income is projected to range from $2.5 billion to $6 billion in the third quarter, versus $6.2 billion in the same quarter of last year.



On the company’s Q2 earnings call, Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky elaborated further on the revenues growth rate, stating, “Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend.”



Furthermore, Olsavsky added that the company expects “this pattern of difficult year-on-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters.”



Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White expects that AMZN will meet the analyst’s revenue forecast of $111 billion (a growth of 15% year-over-year) and the earnings estimate of $9.05 per share.



The analyst added that given that Prime Day was held in the second (June) quarter, rather than the traditional July timeframe, it is likely that the company is likely to experience a first sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in net sales in Q3.



White is bullish, with a Buy rating and a price target of $4,500 (34.9% upside) on the stock.



When it comes to Amazon’s cloud services business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), White expects AWS to register a year-over-year growth of 33% with revenues of $15.4 billion in Q3. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)



In Q2, AWS posted revenues of $14.8 billion, up 37% year-over-year and comprising 13% of the company’s total revenues of $113.08 billion. Furthermore, reflecting the upward trajectory of this business, the company’s management said on its Q2 earnings call that currently, AWS is “a $59 billion annualized run rate business, and that's up from $43 billion at this time last year.”



Analyst White is also positive about AMZN's growth across its different segments including e-commerce, Alexa, digital media and advertising. However, the analyst cautioned that as “Amazon continues to aggressively invest back into the business to grow at a rapid rate, the company’s profitability is well below its long-term potential.”



As a result, the analyst believes that “traditional P/E metrics are not applicable, nor other profit metrics, thus we value the stock on an enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio.”



Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are bullish about Amazon, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys.



The average Amazon price target of $4,180.13 implies 25.3% upside potential from current levels.







eBay (EBAY)



eBay is an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers in 190 markets around the world. The company is expected to announce its Q3 results on October 27.



In Q3, eBay anticipates earning revenues between $2.4 billion to $2.47 billion, with an organic currency-neutral growth rate between 6% and 8% year-on-year. Adjusted diluted earnings are expected to come in between $0.86 per share and $0.90 per share.



Currently, the company is in a transition phase. In July this year, eBay announced that it will reduce its 44% stake in Adevinta, an online classified marketplace, to approximately 33%. The company will sell around 125 million Adevinta shares, with an option to sell an additional 10 million shares to Permira, an investment firm, for approximately $2.25 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.



In addition, eBay will sell off 80% of its business in Korea, for around $3 billion, to Emart. The deal is likely to close by the end of this year or early next year.



Jamie Iannone, eBay’s President and CEO, commented on its Q2 earnings call, “These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward.”



It seems that the company’s core business is doing well, as Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian’s ebay.com tracker seemed to indicate that “volume trends are directionally in-line with estimates.” Furthermore, the analyst added, “In our tracker, Q3 volume is ~15% above comparable 2019 levels.”



The analyst is bullish, with a Buy rating. He raised the price target from $70 to $80 on the stock.  



Moreover, Sebastian is of the view that the company’s “Managed Payments will provide significant boost to revenues and profits over the next 2-3 years.”



Managed Payments is eBay’s own payment platform that processes payments for purchases through eBay. Indeed, in Q2, 71% of buying on eBay was processed through Managed Payments. Moreover, the company’s management commented on its earnings call, “We exited Q2 at a run rate over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter.” (See Top Smart Score stocks on TipRanks)



The analyst is also positive about the company’s advertising momentum, growth in e-commerce, and focus on technology.



 Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about eBay, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 8 Holds.



The average eBay price target of $76.57 implies approximately 5% downside potential from current levels.







Bottom Line



Analysts are bullish about Amazon while they are cautiously optimistic about eBay. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Amazon does seem to be a better Buy.

14142,"Amazon (AMZN) saw exponential growth in 2020 with pandemic-driven tailwinds pushing it forward. 2021, however, has turned out to be much more of a challenge on several levels, resulting in the stock’s underperformance.



Jefferies’ Brent Thill cites “difficult comps, labor shortages, and supply-chain disruptions” as reasons why Amazon’s “multiple” has dropped by ~25% since mid-2020.



Despite the segment representing just 12% of the company’s Operating Income (69% of sales), the analyst believes the “key overhang” has been the slowdown in core-Retail sales growth as the company has encountered some very tough comps.



The Q2 sales shortfall - the first miss in 3 almost years - along with “continuing pressure” on operating income margin due to logistics investments and a “tight” labor market, was not well-received by investors. Add to that the fact Amazon’s Q3 sales guidance was 6% lower than the high end of the Street’s and you can understand investors’ concerns.



However, Thill thinks the worries are overblown. “Despite the slowdown, our 2H core-Retail Sales estimate represents ~24% 2-yr growth, which is above pre-pandemic levels (18% in FY19) and supports our view that e-comm adoption has permanently increased,” the 5-star analyst reassured.



Furthermore, as the “temporary headwinds” fade, Thill expects margins and FCF will “better reflect the benefit of faster growth” in the higher-margin AWS and Advertising. These are elements of Amazon’s business Thill thinks the market “underappreciates,” believing these segments to be “key drivers of shareholder value. “



While the pair made up only 17% of revenue in 2020, they provided the bulk of Operating Income (75%) while representing 64% of Thill’s SOTP (sum of the parts) valuation. Both also beat consensus estimates in Q2 and “accelerated sequentially.” As such, the analyst sees “faster growth in AMZN's highest-margin businesses, resulting in upside to consensus Op Income over time.”



With lowered expectations following the 3Q guide-down and abetted by the aforementioned ~25% “multiple compression”, Amazon offers an “attractive risk-reward.”



To this end, Thill reiterated a Buy rating, backed by a $4,200 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 22%. (To watch Thill’s track record, click here)



The rest of the Street agrees almost to a tee; the average price target is virtually identical to Thill’s. Additionally, there are only Buy reviews on record for the ecommerce giant – 31, in fact – all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See Amazon stock analysis on TipRanks)
