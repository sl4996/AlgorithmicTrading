Centene is a government-sponsored healthcare provider with services under Medicare, Medicaid, and commercially managed care. Centene has projected revenue of $125 billion for the fiscal year 2021, providing healthcare to nearly 1 in 15 individuals nationwide. Its shares have gained 35.6% over the past year.



CEO Retirement



Michael Neidorff, the current Chairman and CEO of Centene, has put forward his intent to retire in 2022. He will continue as the Executive Chairman untill the end of 2022, after a suitable successor is found.



Neidorff joined Centene as CEO in 1996 and revolutionized the healthcare company, from a $40 million local provider to a $125 billion market leader, which also boasts of being a national Fortune 24 and a global Fortune 57 company. 



Under his leadership, the company has grown with nearly 76,000 employees serving 26.5 million members across all 50 states in the U.S. and 3 other countries.



Changes in the Board



Centene also announced changes to its Board of Directors, with 5 new directors to be appointed on January 5, 2022. Moreover, current Director James Dallas will immediately become the Lead Independent Director and will later become the Independent Chairman by the end of 2022.



The new Board will be responsible for the appointment of the new CEO for Centene. The Board is expected to follow an in-depth selection process and evaluate both internal and external candidates with the help of an external search firm.



Management Comments



Neidorff said, “Nothing has been more important to me than providing the highest quality of care to the most vulnerable populations we serve… I have been in discussions with the Board about my retirement plans since the summer, and today I have informed the Board of my decision to retire as CEO in 2022.”



Robert Ditmore, Director of Centene, said, “While it is difficult to put into words the immeasurable impact he has had on this company and the members whose health has been transformed, and the communities that have been served, on behalf of all the Board at Centene we are immensely grateful and proud of the work Michael has inspired and delivered as our CEO.”

876,"Multinational healthcare firm Centene Corp. (CNC) has issued guidance for 2022 and provided details of its Value Creation Plan.



Based in Missouri, the company serves as an intermediary for government-sponsored and privately-insured healthcare programs.



Following the announcement, the company’s shares closed 4.8% up on Friday. They gained another 1.1% in after-hours trading to end the day at $79.30.



2022 Guidance



For 2022, Centene expects total revenues in the range of $135.9 billion to $137.9 billion, versus the Street’s estimate of $133.05 billion.



Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is anticipated to lie between $5.30 and $5.50, with the consensus estimate standing at $5.38.



2021 Guidance



Meanwhile, the company has reiterated its 2021 guidance and expects total revenues and adjusted EPS to range from $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion and $5.05 to $5.15, respectively.



Analysts expect the healthcare provider to report revenues of $126.24 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.11. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)



Value Creation Plan



Under the Value Creation Plan, the company will focus on strategic capital allocation, gross margin improvement, and SG&A savings. It will also review its non-core assets and evaluate strategic alternatives for its international business.



As a result of the plan, Centene expects adjusted EPS in the range of $7.50 to $7.75 for 2024.



Wall Street’s Take



Recently, Cowen & Co. (COWN) analyst Gary Taylor maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 (8.4% upside potential).



The analyst said, “CNC is our Best Idea for 2022. We believe the market is undervaluing the opportunity for margin expansion and share repurchase over the next three years. In addition, activist interest in the stock suggests that well-known healthcare executives could be added to the Board of Directors. We believe CNC’s P/E multiple will expand as the market gains confidence in this new trajectory.”



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Centene price target of $81.50 implies nearly 4% upside potential. Shares have gained 31.3% over the past year.



Smart Score



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, Centene scores a 9 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.
