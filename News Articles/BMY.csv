1846,"Bristol Myers (BMY) has entered into a license, development, and commercialization agreement with clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Immatics NV for TCR Bispecific candidate IMA401. BMY shares rose 0.78% to close at $59.51 on December 14.



Bristol Myers is a pharmaceutical company that designs, develops, manufactures, licenses, and sells biopharmaceutical products.



Immatics Collaboration



Immatics will receive an upfront payment of $150 million as part of the licensing and commercialization agreement with Bristol Myers. It is also entitled to $770 million in development regulatory and commercial milestone payments and double-digit royalty payments on net sales of IMA401.



IMA401 is the most advanced Immatics product candidate under the TCR Bispecifics pipeline dubbed TCER® (T Cell Engaging Receptors). The product candidate has already shown anti-tumor activity with complete remission. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)



According to Bristol Myers Senior Vice President Teri Foy, TCER is an important modality for solid tumors. The company plans to advance IMA401 development as an innovative medicine for addressing serious diseases.



Bristol Myers' latest deal builds on its strategic collaboration between Immatics and its wholly-owned subsidiary Celgene Corporation. Consequently, the collaboration is expected to complement its ongoing cell therapy activities.



Stock Rating



Last week, Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal reiterated a Hold rating on Bristol Myers with a $58 price target, implying 2.54% downside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, the company faces challenges as a result of continuous patent losses. Additionally, the company’s pipeline might not be sufficient to counter the size of its patent losses by 2030. 



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Bristol Myers price target of $68.88 implies 15.75% upside potential to current levels.

1993,"Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) announced that it has received a Marketing Authorization from the European Commission (EC) for Zeposia (ozanimod) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). These patients include individuals who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or have been intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 



Zeposia is the first-of-its-kind oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator for UC, representing an innovative way of treating this disease. 



The regulator’s approval followed the data from True North, a pivotal Phase 3 trial, which is designed to evaluate Zeposia as an induction and maintenance therapy versus placebo. Results have demonstrated that Zeposia has significant, durable efficacy in patients with moderate to severe UC across clinical, endoscopic and mucosal healing endpoints, with no new safety signals.



Official Comments 



The Senior VP of Immunology and Fibrosis Development at Bristol Myers Squibb, Jonathan Sadeh, said, ""With today’s European Commission approval of Zeposia for ulcerative colitis, patients and physicians now have a once-daily oral treatment option to help address this debilitating disease, with a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile and a different mechanism of action than other available therapies."" (See Bristol Myers Squibb stock charts on TipRanks) 



Other Approvals 



In May 2021, Zeposia was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC, and for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in March 2020.



Additionally, in May 2020, the EC approved Zeposia for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 



Wall Street’s Take 



On November 18, BMO Capital analyst Evan Seigerman initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $72 (25.33% upside potential).  



In a research note to investors, Seigerman said that the strong fundamentals of the company are not fully reflected in the current valuation as well the margin expansion potential.  



The analyst considers shares of the company as favorable compared to its U.S. major pharma and large-cap biotechnology peers. 



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock and has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Bristol Myers Squibb price target of $73.86 implies 28.56% upside potential. Shares have lost 9.1% over the past year. 



Smart Score 



According to the TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, Bristol Myers Squibb gets a 6 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)

2049,"During a Late-Breaking Science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2021, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) company, presented results from the Phase 2 AXIOMATIC-TKR study in patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery.  



This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milvexian, a first-of-its-kind oral factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, compared to enoxaparin. 



The data demonstrated by the global biopharmaceutical company showed that investigational oral milvexian reduced the risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a dose dependent manner without increasing the risk of bleeding compared with enoxaparin, the company said.  



The Phase 2 milvexian program has two studies, of which the TKR study is the first one. Notably, results from the ongoing Phase 2 study of milvexian for secondary stroke prevention (AXIOMATIC-SSP) are expected to be released in the first half of 2022. (See Bristol Myers Squibb stock charts on TipRanks) 



Official Comments 



The SVP and Head of cardiovascular development at Bristol Myers Squibb, Roland Chen, said, “We are encouraged by the results of the milvexian TKR trial, which are consistent with our scientific understanding of the FXIa mechanism. The clear dose efficacy response without increased bleeding provides additional evidence to support our belief in the promise of milvexian. We look forward to results from our second Phase 2 trial of milvexian for secondary stroke prevention, which will add to our body of evidence for milvexian and help inform our Phase 3 development program.”

Wall Street’s Take 



Recently, Argus Research analyst David Toung downgraded Bristol Myers Squibb to Hold from Buy.  



According to Toung, the company's product, Revlimid, which contributes the largest portion to total revenues, is likely to face generic competition both in the U.S. and overseas in 2022. The analyst expects this to ""weigh heavily"" on the company’s revenue growth.  



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock and has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Bristol Myers Squibb price target of $74.17 implies 24.4% upside potential from current levels. Shares have lost 7.6% over the past year. 



Risk Analysis 



According to the new TipRanks’ Risk Factors tool, the Bristol Myers Squibb stock is at risk mainly from three factors: Finance and Corporate, Tech and Innovation, and Legal and Regulatory, which contribute 26%, 22%, and 19%, respectively, to the total 27 risks identified for the stock.

2170,"American pharmaceutical industry company Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has posted better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of 2021. However, revenues missed analysts’ expectations. The company has also updated its guidance for 2021.



Following the news, shares of the company declined 2.2% to close at $56.49 on Wednesday.



The company recorded adjusted earnings of $2 per share, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.94 per share. Bristol Myers had reported adjusted earnings of $1.63 per share in the same quarter last year.



Total revenues generated during the quarter stood at $11.62 billion, up 10% year-over-year, but fell short of the Street’s estimate of $11.64 billion. Increased acceptance of the company’s new product portfolio and continued demand growth across all four core therapeutic areas acted as tailwinds for revenues.



See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>



Notably, U.S. revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $7.3 billion on the back of higher demand for Revlimid, Eliquis and new product portfolio. Also, International revenues jumped 8% to $4.3 billion, driven by elevated demand for Eliquis, Revlimid and Opdivo.



While marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 5% year-over-year to $1.8 billion during the quarter, research and development expenses reflected a rise of 30% to $3.3 billion.



Pipeline Update & Guidance



The CEO of Bristol Myers, Giovanni Caforio, said, “Our teams advanced the product portfolio and achieved significant regulatory and clinical milestones, including for the fixed-dose combination of relatlimab and nivolumab. Our deep and diverse product pipeline, commercial execution and financial flexibility provide a strong foundation that is enabling the company to bring new medicines that benefit patients with serious unmet needs, drive in-line product performance and deliver sustained growth.” (See Bristol Myers stock charts on TipRanks)



For 2021, the company expects adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.40 to $7.55, compared to the consensus estimate of $7.47. The prior range stood at earnings of $7.35 per share to $7.55 per share.



Analysts Recommendation



On October 25, Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $75 (32.77% upside potential). The analyst believes that Bristol’s existing presence with rheumatologists through Orencia reflects commercial synergies.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 7 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Bristol Myers price target stands at $74.88, implying upside potential at 32.55% over the next 12 months.



Risk Analysis 



According to the new TipRanks’ Risk Factors tool, the Bristol Myers stock is at risk mainly from three factors: Finance and Corporate, Tech and Innovation, and Legal and Regulatory, which contribute 26%, 22% and 19%, respectively, to the total 27 risks identified for the stock.
