837,"The list of headwinds for equity investors has increased in 2022. Record high inflation, continued supply concerns, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflict, and the pandemic in the background point to a slowdown in the economy.  Regardless of the economic situation, the demand for essentials like food, beverages, personal care, and cleaning products remains stable, thus making consumer staples stocks a safer investment amid turbulent times. Also, these companies can protect their margins amid inflation by passing on the cost to consumers.  The recent batch of earnings confirms that top consumer staples companies are navigating the current challenges well. For context, Coca-Cola recently delivered impressive organic sales and managed to expand operating margins amid a challenging operating environment. Thanks to its stellar performance, Coca-Cola stock recently hit an all-time high of $67.20.  Further, Procter & Gamble delivered solid organic sales growth of 10% during the most recent quarter, led by higher volumes and pricing. Meanwhile, confectionery and snack food giant Mondelez delivered solid organic revenues aided by higher pricing and volume growth. Moreover, Costco is firing on all cylinders, reflected through its robust comparable sales growth. Also, it recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 9%.  Let’s now take a look at these companies individually to ascertain why these consumer staples stocks look attractive in the current climate. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Coca-Cola’s CEO, James Quincey, is confident of achieving the full-year guidance and delivering strong top-line growth in 2022. Quincey added that Coca-Cola is “well-equipped to win in all types of environments as we fuel strong top line momentum and create value for our stakeholders.” Coca-Cola expects to deliver organic sales growth of 7-8% in 2022. Further, it projects adjusted EPS growth of 5-6% and free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion.  Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein stated, “We see a positive set-up for KO over the next 1-2 years as mobility recovers, commodity inflation (presumably) peaks, and recession-worried investors move into Staples.” On TipRanks, KO stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buy and five Hold recommendations. Further, the average Coca-Cola price target of $70 implies 7.6% upside potential to current levels. Also, Coca-cola stock has a maximum Smart Score rating of 10 out of 10. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Due to the ongoing momentum in its business, Procter & Gamble raised its revenue growth forecast for FY22. PG now expects organic sales to increase by 6-7%. Moreover, it projects core EPS to increase by 3-6%. Also, Procter & Gamble plans to pay $8 billion in dividends and repurchase stocks worth about $10 billion in FY22.  In response to PG’s recent quarterly performance, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy stated, “PG Remains a Core Staples Holding.”  Grundy added, “With strong demand outlook, though partially offset by a tough cost environment, the durability of P&G’s business model, brand strength (evidenced by mkt share momentum), scale advantages, pricing power, and strong leadership were all evident in the qtr.” On TipRanks, PG stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buy and six Hold recommendations. Further, the average Procter & Gamble price target of $170.43 implies 6.7% upside potential to current levels.  Costco (NASDAQ:COST) Costco continues to post double-digit comparable sales growth regardless of inflation and supply-chain worries. Its value offerings and high membership renewal rates bode well for growth.  Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial is bullish about COST stock and expects it to benefit from solid demand and membership growth. Feinseth stated, “COST’s incredible merchandising and supply chain management capabilities combined with ongoing store growth and international expansion will continue to drive strong Business Performance trends.” COST stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy and four Hold recommendations. Further, the average Costco price target of $608.50 implies 9.9% upside potential to current levels. Also, Costco stock has a maximum ""Perfect 10"" Smart Score rating. Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Mondelez’s top line could benefit from additional pricing actions and higher volumes. Moreover, it announced the acquisition of Grupo Bimbo’s confectionery business – Ricolino – for $1.3 billion.  In response to this, Mizuho Securities analyst John Baumgartner stated that Mexico is a “High-Priority” market and the acquisition of Ricolino “adds scale.” The analyst added that the deal “will double the size of MDLZ’s Mexico business and significantly accelerate capabilities.”  Baumgartner, together with the rest of the Street, is bullish on MDLZ stock. Its Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 12 unanimous Buy recommendations. Further, the average Mondelez price target of $72.67 implies 13.5% upside potential to current levels. MDLZ stock also has a maximum Smart Score of 10 out of 10. Bottom Line  The momentum in their businesses is likely to sustain irrespective of the economic situation, implying that investors can expect these consumer staples companies to deliver profitable growth in the coming quarters and generate strong cash flows to support share buybacks and dividend payments.  Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.

988,"Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (PG) offers a vast portfolio of branded home and personal care products. On April 20, the corporation will release its financial results for the fiscal third quarter of 2022. PG has done a good job of keeping its shareholders satisfied. The stock has increased by 4% over the last month and 13% over the past six months. With earnings season in full gear, investors will be watching the company's performance in the upcoming quarter with bated breath. Macro-Economic Conditions Remain Favorable The current macroeconomic environment favors defensive stocks, including healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, like Procter & Gamble. As inflation reaches all-time highs and interest rates rise, consumers may turn away from non-essential products. However, Procter & Gamble may have some leeway to raise prices and pass on the increased costs to customers. With prices climbing, defensive stocks may also be ""inflationary hedges to some extent,"" according to Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. Mahajan adds, ""When you think about where there is a bit more pricing power, consumers will have to purchase their staples, their healthcare, probably pay their utility bills, regardless of the price increases."" Q3 Expectations According to analysts, Procter & Gamble is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share. This represents a year-over-year increase of 3.2%. Procter & Gamble has beaten profit estimates in the preceding eight quarters and looks likely to do so again in Q3. Website Trends Are Encouraging We also used TipRanks' new online tool to track user visits to the Procter & Gamble website to gain a better idea of the company's performance ahead of the fiscal Q3 print. Notably, the tool revealed positive patterns on the website, which may be reassuring to investors. We found that forecast visits to Procter & Gamble's website increased in Q3. In particular, the total projected worldwide visits to the PG website increased by 44.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Differing Views Olivia Tong, a Raymond James analyst, is optimistic about Procter & Gamble's future prospects. She feels that P&G's strategy and modifications to the company’s portfolio have paid off in recent years, resulting in improved top-and bottom-line growth. Tong is also impressed with the company's ability to protect itself from increased volatility in the market while focusing on innovation that will help PG to retain its recent momentum. The analyst initiated coverage of Procter & Gamble with a Buy rating and a price target of $175, reflecting 11.4% upside potential from current levels. Not all analysts, though, are bullish on the stock. JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira recently downgraded the stock to a Hold from a Buy and decreased the price target to $165 from $181. This implies 5.1% upside potential from current levels. Teixeira feels that ""current cost and currency headwinds"" will have an impact on P&G's upcoming results to some extent. Wall Street’s Take That said, Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Procter & Gamble stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and five Holds. As for price targets, the average PG price target of $167.55 implies almost 7% upside potential from current levels. Bottom Line Procter & Gamble is a company with a strong competitive advantage. It has the ability to announce outstanding results for the fiscal third quarter, which should boost its stock price. On the other hand, cost pressures could be a thorn in its side in the upcoming quarter. Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.  Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure",2022-04-19

1056,"3M (MMM) is one of the leading manufacturers of products utilized in the Safety and Industrial applications, Transportation and Electronics, and Health Care services. The company develops general consumer products (the Consumer segment) such as home improvement and stationery products as well. 3M's diversified portfolio comprises thousands of products which the company distributes through multiple channels, including direct to consumer and via various e-commerce and traditional wholesalers. Backed by its prolonged dominance in the industry that has lasted for nearly a century and the constant demand for 3M's tools and mission-critical products, the company features a long track record of robust revenue and net income generation. Consequently, 3M has been able to reward its shareholder with growing capital returns for several decades. Specifically, 3M boasts a track record of 64 consecutive annual dividend hikes - one of the most extended records in history. Following the stock's decline over the past few months, 3M now trades with a dividend yield close to 4%, which income-oriented investors are likely to appreciate. However, apart from the dividend, 3M's total return prospects remain rather underwhelming, in my view. Thus, I am neutral on the stock. Recent Performance 3M's Q4 results came in rather solid, with the company achieving organic local-currency revenue growth of 1.3%, leading to full-year sales of $35.4 billion, 9.9% higher compared to the previous year. Specifically, Safety & Industrial revenues came in 2.2% lower to $3.1 billion but still rather solid amid strong sales in closure and masking systems, abrasives, industrial adhesives, and tapes. The Transportation & Electronics and Health Care segments also reported slightly lower sales, declining by 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. However, the Consumer segment offset these downfalls as its organic sales increased 4.9% to $1.5 billion, driven by increased revenues in health and safety, stationery and office, home improvement, and home care products. Despite the ongoing hurdles industrial companies currently face when it comes to rising costs all across the board, 3M managed to retain strong margins. Specifically, the company ended the year with an operating income of $7.4 billion, suggesting an operating margin close to 20.8%. Accordingly, the bottom line came in rather strong during Fiscal 2021, with adjusted earnings per share landing at $10.12 versus $8.85 in Fiscal 2020, an increase of 14.3%. Three weeks following its earnings release, management provided its guidance for Fiscal 2022, which points towards another year of stable sales. Management expects total sales growth to be between 1% and 4%, including organic sales growth between 2% and 5%. EPS is also expected to land between $10.15 and $10.65, implying growth of 10.4% at the midpoint relative to last year. Seeing the company expecting double-digit EPS growth is admittedly quite impressive in the current rising-costs environment. Is the Dividend Worth It? As I mentioned, with a 64-year dividend growth track record, 3M is considered one of the most trustworthy stocks amongst income-oriented investors. In fact, Dover Corp. (DOV), Genuine Parts Co. (GPC), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR), and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) are the only companies featuring an even lengthier dividend growth track record, counting 66, 66, 65, and 65 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, respectively. Combined with the stock's decline, which has pushed the yield close to 4%, 3M appears rather attractive when it comes to its income prospects. Further, the midpoint of management's EPS guidance implies a payout ratio of 57.3%, which suggests enough room for further DPS hikes ahead. That said, investors should not expect meaningful dividend hikes ahead, in my view. While the company's guidance implies double-digit EPS growth for Fiscal 2022, this should not be the norm going forward. 3M's 10-year EPS CAGR stands at just 3.45%, and this includes buybacks that have artificially boosted EPS during this period. After all, the latest guidance implies tiny levels of sales growth as well. Thus, while 3M is likely to keep growing the dividend, it is likely to do so at an unhurried pace to retain a relatively healthy payout ratio over rather stagnated earnings. This is evidenced by the company's three-year DPS CAGR, which stands at just 2.86%. The latest dividend hike also points toward this narrative, as the rate of increase was by an even more inferior 0.7%. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, 3M has a Moderate Sell consensus rating, based on one Buy, eight Holds, and five Sells assigned in the past three months. At $164.36, the average 3M price target implies 9.2% upside potential. Conclusion 3M is, without a doubt, a legendary dividend-paying stock that is likely to continue serving income-oriented investors rather well. That said, the company is very mature, and sales growth should hardly surpass the single-digit rates going forward. Therefore, it's quite likely that dividend growth will underperform inflation substantially in the coming years. Consequently, while the company features robust qualities, including stable and predictable cash flows, investors should not expect extraordinary total returns ahead.

1446,"Procter & Gamble (PG) is a consumer products behemoth operating in more than 180 countries. 



The company's well-known brands include Pampers, Luvs, Tide, Gain, Bounty, Charmin, Puffs, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Dawn, Febreze, Swiffer, Crest, Oral-B, Scope, Olay, and many other established names. 



The company's business model leans on the continued growth andsuccess of its current brands and products, as well as through the innovation of new products and brands. 



The consumer staples sector is incredibly competitive, and so PG's sheer size makes for a great competitive advantage as it can achieve tremendous economies of scale through efficient cost and production management. The $376-billion company is the highest-valued company in the world in the sector, by far.



In my view, PG's latest results once again demonstrated the company's strength and resilience despite the ongoing challenges, including the current supply chain challenges. 



That said, I continue to find the stock rather expensive, which could result in valuation headwinds going forward. For this reason, I am neutral on the stock.  



Latest Results 



PG's Q2-2022 results came in quite strong, with net sales reaching $21 billion, an increase of 6% versus the prior-year period. PG enjoys top-tier production capabilities and solid pricing power due to its products having a robust brand value.



This was particularly demonstrated in Q2's numbers, as growing revenues were supported by a 3% growth increase in shipment volumes and a 3% increase in prices. 



Hence, the company was able to compensate for the significant commodity and overall input cost growth resulting from ongoing inflation.   



Operating margins for the quarter actually declined 250 basis points year-over-year. However, the company still managed to post EPS of $1.66, a 13% increase versus the prior-year period, which included a charge for the early extinguishment of debt. 



EPS growth was partially assisted by the company's share repurchases, with the company repurchasing $5 billion worth of common stock during the quarter.



Amid better-than-expected results so far through the year, the company lifted its outlook for its full-year all-in sales growth from 2%-4% to 3%-4%. 



Management expects EPS to land 6%-9% higher than its FY 2021 EPS of $5.50, implying FY 2022 EPS of ~$5.91 at the midpoint. 



Valuation 



Based on PG's projected EPS of about $5.91 for the year, the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 26.6. In my view, this is a steep multiple for the stock, as it implies stronger growth rates that PG is currently delivering. 



Investors are likely paying a premium for the stock, as they appreciate PG's moat, competitive advantage, predictable sales, pricing power, and all such qualities that provide assurance in the current environment surrounded by uncertainty. 



However, at its current valuation, shares could have limited upside ahead, while the 2.2% yield (as much impressive as featuring a 65-year consecutive dividend growth track record is), is not substantial enough to meaningfully add to total returns. 



A P/E in the range of 20-24 would more reasonably value the company, in my view. 



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Procter & Gamble has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on eight Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. 



At $172.50, the average Procter & Gamble price target implies 9.8% upside potential.







Conclusion 



Dividend Aristocrat Procter & Gamble is definitely a high-quality company with multiple competitive edges. 



While the stock is likely to continue performing well, especially for those seeking dividend growth, I find shares rather overvalued at their current levels.

P&G designs, manufactures, and distributes beauty, grooming, healthcare, and baby products. It also deals in feminine & family care products. Procter & Gamble's earnings report for Fiscal Q2 2022 is scheduled for January 19, 2022.



Degradable Tide



The first shipment of the degradable Tide detergent was shipped to space on a SpaceX rocket late last year. Its performance is currently undergoing tests. Currently, there are no laundry solutions available for astronauts in space.



Astronauts have to wear clothes several times and replace them with new ones delivered on resupply. Procter & Gamble is offering a degradable Tide that is optimized for use in about 15 liters of water on a 10-pound load of laundry, instead of using up to 77 liters while washing at home.



By offering a detergent that ensures astronauts can do laundry while in space, Procter & Gamble hopes to address the limited cargo capacity. Additionally, it should address the replenishment problem of longer trips.



Stock Rating



In mid-December, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein reiterated a Buy rating on P&G with a $163 price target. This implies that shares are fully valued at current levels.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 3 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Procter and Gamble price target of $155 implies 4.81% downside potential to current levels.

1875,"Procter & Gamble (PG) operates across ten different segments of the consumer discretionary industry throughout the world. It manufactures household brands such as Bounty, Oral B, Olay, Crest, Gillette, Tide, and Aways. 



The company markets and manufactures so many products across many categories of the customer discretionary industry that it manufacture over half of the disposable products in my bathroom, cleaning supply closet, and laundry room as I write this article.



After reviewing Procter & Gamble stock's intrinsic value, listening to the new CEO's plans for the company during the Morgan Stanley Virtual Global Consumer & Retail Conference, and reading what the Wall Street analysts and bloggers are saying, I am neutral on this stock, in terms of value, because I think it is fairly valued. I do believe this is an attractive stock for dividend investors.



P&G's Strategy Going Forward



What I find exciting about P&G is its ability to strategically alter its focus every five to ten years. This has enabled it to lead the consumer discretionary industry and drive value to shareholders for many years. This can be seen in 1999 when A.G. Lafley, before he became CEO, led the beauty business by implementing its ""prem-tail"" strategy to modernize and bring Oil of Olay into the 21st century as the revamped Olay brand. 



It can be seen now when Jon Moeller, who was made CEO on November 1, 2021, discusses how the company is handling increased competition at the lower end of its pricing ladder and rising labor and supply chain costs across product categories. 



His strategy for the company is to focus on making a superior product, making their products sustainably—with less plastic and packaging, all while increasing efficiency and decreasing the number of touchpoints in the chain of command. 



This has allowed P&G to reinvent its management style while handling all the new issues a global multinational company must navigate during the COVID-19 pandemic. 



What I like about the current management team's strategy is its simplicity to understand. It will create value for employees, retail partners, and long-term shareholders once it has been completed. 



This will allow the company to maintain its free cash flow, dividend payouts, and share price.



Recent Results



P&G's stock has been trading between $121.54 and $164.98 in the past 52 weeks. In other words, the stock is currently trading near its 52-week high.



P&G brought in revenues of $77.45 billion over the last twelve months with a net income of $14.14 billion. 



The company has reported first-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.61 per share, beating analyst estimates of $1.59 per share. It has also reported $5.66 in earnings per share for 2021, beating analyst estimates of $5.20 for 2021. 



Dividend



It is also expected to declare a dividend payable around January 20, 2022, of $0.87. This would equal an annualized dividend yield of 2.1%. PG has increased its dividend every year for the past 65 years. It is again expected to increase its dividend after the January 20 dividend declaration. The dividend growth rate has also increased from 4% to 10% over the past five years. 



If the growth rate is maintained at 10%, this will be one of the rare dividend-paying stocks where the growth rate of the dividend is outpacing inflation, meaning investors are gaining real purchasing power. Most investments lose value during high inflation, and P&G has been an exception.  



The company shows strength on its income statement with high single-digit growth in top-line and bottom-line revenues. It offers a bit of weakness on its balance sheet, though. The company has a current ratio of 0.67. This means that it has two-thirds of the cash and other current assets it needs on hand to pay its bills over the next year. 



When I calculated the stock's intrinsic value by modeling discounted cash flows, I pegged it at $140.58. 



Can the Stock Go Higher?



P&G has done a great job creating value over the past 184 years. I feel the stock has reached its peak, though. I would not buy this stock expecting a significant increase in stock price. I would buy it for the very consistent and consistently growing dividend.



Wall Street's Take



Seven Wall Street analysts currently cover Procter and have issued 12-month estimates for the price. Of the seven analysts, four rate the stock as a Buy, and three rate it a Hold, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average Procter & Gamble price target of $155.71 implies 3% downside potential.







Positive Blogger Sentiment



TipRanks.com shows that of the 48 bloggers that have blogged about Procter & Gamble stock, 89% of them are bullish. The sector average is approximately 72% are bullish on the consumer goods sector in the last three months. 







Conclusion



Based on the intrinsic value, the Wall Street estimates, and the blogger estimates, I am neutral on P&G. P&G has done a great job transforming itself to compete in the 21st century. I think this is an outstanding dividend stock for income investors. However, I would not expect the price to go much higher in the next 12 to 24 months.

1915,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) is the largest company in the consumer staples industry globally, boasting a market capitalization of around $385 billion. 



The company sells its products in more than 180 countries, owning some of the most recognizable brands in the world in its diversified portfolio. 



Examples include Pampers, Luvs, Tide, Gain, Bounty, Charmin, Puffs, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Dawn, Febreze, Swiffer, Crest, Oral-B, Scope, Olay, and many more.



The company has been appreciated highly amongst income-oriented investors due to featuring one of the most impressive and robust dividend growth track records. 



While I admire the company's qualities and growing payouts, I believe that the stock has gotten increasingly pricy, leaving little to no room for further upside at its current levels. For this reason, I am neutral on the stock. 



Recent Results



Back in October, Procter & Gamble posted its Q1 2022 results, featuring a very solid performance. During the quarter, the company produced $20.3 billion in sales, a 5% growth compared to Q1 2021. 



Higher sales were attributable sales growth of 5%, 5%, 8%, 5%, and 3% in the company’s Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care divisions, respectively. 



Adjusted EPS came in at $1.61 compared to $1.63 in the comparable period last year, while management guided for revenue growth of 2% to 4% and EPS growth of 3% to 6% for FY 2022. 



The Dividend 



Procter & Gamble has paid a dividend for 131 years. It has also increased its dividend for 65 consecutive years, which is one of the longest active streaks of any company. 



This places the company on the elite S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which includes companies that feature a track record of more than 25 annual consecutive DPS hikes. Few Dividend Stocks boast of such a track record. 



The latest dividend hike back in April was by an impressive 10% to a quarterly rate of $0.8698. This DPS hike far outpaces even the current accelerated inflation levels, which income-oriented investors should highly appreciate. 



Further, due to the majority of Procter & Gamble's products comprising daily necessities, their demand is highly inelastic. This means that if inflation continues to hover at the current worrying levels, the company can still substantially increase prices without suffering a significant, if any, disruption on the demand side. 



Hence, Procter & Gamble can be considered a rather inflation-proof company, which should translate to in-line or above-average inflation dividend growth prospects moving forward. 



Assuming Procter & Gamble's FY 2022 earnings report ends up with EPS of around $5.92 (in-line with management's outlook), this implies a payout ratio of just under 60%. Hence, the company can easily sustain robust DPS hikes from this perspective as well. 



The Valuation 



Based on the aforementioned FY2022 EPS estimate, Procter & Gamble's shares are currently trading with a (forward) P/E of around 26.9 attached. In my view, this is a premium multiple for a company in the industry. 



While I appreciate Procter & Gamble's unique qualities and strong dividend growth prospects, I believe that a fair multiple for the stock would be in the low 20s based on this year's expected earnings growth and overall investment case.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Procter & Gamble has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. At $155.71, Procter & Gamble stock projections suggest 2.3% downside potential.

1992,"Headquartered in Cincinnati, Procter & Gamble (PG) is a manufacturer and seller of branded packaged consumer goods. Its products center around five segments, including Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. 



Another government shutdown might be expected if the fast-spreading omicron variant of the coronavirus persists, which could benefit some sectors, including the consumer staples sector. Therefore, by being one of the largest producers of household items and holding a significant market share in areas like healthcare, baby care, home care, and feminine care, among others, P&G could be a golden egg in investors’ baskets. 



Price Trend 



The company has shown consistent price performance, reflecting an overall uptrend. As a result, the stock has gained 9.9% over the past year and 10.1% so far this year. Over the past five years, shares of P&G have gained almost 80%.



P&G Action on Climate Change



In September, P&G revealed its plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations and supply chain, from raw material to retailer, by 2040, along with its interim 2030 goals. Targets include reducing emissions across the company’s operations by 50%, and 40% across the supply chain.



Currently, with the climate crisis affecting every home and family globally, consumers are seeking environment-friendly products, so it appears that the company’s plan is moving in the right direction.



P&G CEO David S. Taylor commented, “We are fully committed to use P&G’s innovation and ingenuity to unlock new solutions to address climate change. The task ahead of us is urgent, difficult and much bigger than any single company or country. P&G is tackling these challenges head-on by reducing our footprint and leveraging our scale to foster unprecedented collaboration across our value chain.”



Dividend History



Investors looking for investment options with a steady source of income could consider P&G. The company has a strong track record of dividend payments with consecutive increases.



The company has come a long way in terms of its quarterly cash dividend payments, from $0.40 per share in 2009 to $0.87 in 2021. The company’s annual dividend of $3.48 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 2.29%.



Earnings Expectations



P&G is likely to release its second-quarter Fiscal 2022 earnings results in mid-January. Analysts expect earnings of $1.66 per share on revenues of $20.38 billion.



See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >> 



Earnings Recap 



On October 19, the company reported outstanding first-quarter Fiscal 2022 earnings (ended September 30). Net sales in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year to $20.3 billion, exceeding consensus estimates of $19.91 billion. Earnings declined 1% to $1.61 per share but still topped the Street’s estimate of $1.59.



For Fiscal 2022, P&G expects sales growth in the range of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis, while GAAP diluted EPS is expected to grow between 6% and 9%. 



Supportive TipRanks Metrics



The analytics tools on TipRanks show some impressive positive stats about the company.



P&G stock scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. 



Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 91% Bullish on PG, compared to a sector average of 70%. 



Additionally, TipRanks’ Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), the world’s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into P&G’s performance. According to the tool, the P&G website recorded a 21.89% increase in global visits in November compared to the same period last year. Also, a quarter-to-date comparison showed growth of 15.42% compared to Q2 2021, and year-to-date website traffic growth stands at 2.85%.



Expert’s Opinion 



Following the first-quarter earnings results, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $163 (7.41% upside potential) from $162. 



Grundy commented, ""The cost/supply chain environment pose material headwinds in FY22; however, intra-quarter US consumption trends accelerated in F1Q and should help drive modest upside in the quarter...Strong 1Q upside is supportive of further multiple expansion; Buy."" 



Wall Street’s Take



The Street is cautiously optimistic on P&G, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Procter & Gamble price target of $156.67 implies 3.24% upside potential to current levels.
