821,"Last week marked the second consecutive weekly decline in oil prices, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, closing 1% weaker at $98.26 a barrel on April 8. Oil prices fell on a weekly basis as the member countries of the International Energy Agency, including the U.S., announced their plans to release more reserves to bring down global prices. The recovery in energy demand following the reopening of economies and the Ukraine-Russia crisis triggered a sharp rise in oil and gas prices, benefiting stocks in the energy sector. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP), which includes major oil and gas companies, has rallied 46% year-to-date. We used the TipRanks stock comparison tool for energy stocks to compare Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips to see if Wall Street analysts see further upside potential in these stocks following a strong run.   Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) Exxon Mobil is one of the largest integrated energy companies and is involved in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and natural gas. It markets fuels, lubricants, and chemicals under four brands –Esso, Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil. A rebound in oil and gas prices fueled by the recovery in energy demand drove a 57.3% rise in the company’s 2021 revenue to $285.6 billion. Adjusted EPS came in at $5.38 in 2021, compared to a loss per share of $0.33 in 2020. The company cut its capital spending to $16.6 billion in 2021 from $21.4 billion in 2020. The energy giant generated operating cash flows of $48 billion in 2021, which according to the company, is the highest level since 2012 and reflects a significant rise compared to $14.7 billion in 2020. Further, Exxon reduced its debt by $20 billion in 2021, bringing debt back to pre-pandemic levels. Exxon’s initiatives to streamline its business and cut down its costs helped deliver savings of $1.9 billion in 2021. It is now on track to exceed its target of reducing costs by $6 billion by 2023. Given its improved financial position, Exxon initiated share repurchases in Q122 as part of its $10 billion buyback program over the next 12 to 24 months. Also, Exxon retained its status as a dividend aristocrat (a term used for companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years) by increasing its quarterly dividend to $0.88 from $0.87. This marked the 39th consecutive annual dividend hike. Exxon’s forward dividend yield stands at 4.1%. Following Exxon’s recent favorable update about Q122, Bank of America Securities analyst Doug Leggate raised his estimate for Q122 EPS from $2.15 to $2.18. The analyst noted that the upward revision in guidance was “driven mainly by strong upstream earnings more than offsetting slightly lower contributions from Chemicals and Corporate QoQ with downstream relatively in-line.” Leggate added, “XOM has hit its debt targets, is ready to accelerate buy backs in our view and is the only major to emerge from COVID with line of sight to expand FcF [Free Cash Flow].” Leggate maintained a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil stock, with a price target of $120. Meanwhile, the Street is cautiously optimistic about Exxon Mobil based on 10 Buys and 13 Holds. At $89.59, the average Exxon Mobil price target implies a modest 3.17% upside potential from current levels. The stock has rallied about 42% year-to-date.   Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) Integrated energy company Chevron delivered mixed Q421 results earlier this year, with revenue beating analysts’ estimates and earnings lagging the Street’s expectations. Q421 earnings were impacted by weaker-than-estimated production. Chevron’s revenue increased 72% to $162.5 billion in 2021, and adjusted EPS surged to $8.13 from $0.09 in 2020, a year severely impacted by a pandemic-induced slump in demand.   Higher crude oil and natural gas prices helped boost Chevron’s operating cash flows to $29.2 billion in 2021 from $10.6 billion in 2020. This helped the company reduce debt by $12.9 billion. Chevron's capital and exploratory expenditures came in at $11.7 billion in 2021, compared to $13.5 billion in 2020. Chevron anticipates capital spending in the $15 billion to $17 billion range for the next five years.   The company aims to grow its renewable fuels production capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by 2030 and is acquiring Renewable Energy Group in a $3.15 billion cash deal to accelerate this goal. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022. Chevron is also a dividend aristocrat and has increased its dividends for 35 consecutive years, including a 6% hike in its quarterly dividend per share this year to $1.42. Chevron’s forward dividend yield is 3.3%. Recently, UBS analyst Luiz Carvalho raised his price target on Chevron stock to $192 from $150 and reaffirmed a Buy rating, citing the company's lower exposure to Russia than its peers along with his updated crude oil price deck forecasts. However, RBC Capital analyst Biraj Borkhataria told investors, “CVX has outperformed the rest of the integrateds by some margin and we believe shares may take a pause in the near term as analysts calibrate company specific issues for 1Q. Notably, our Chevron earnings estimate is the only one where we're below consensus across the group.” Borkhataria has a Buy rating on Chevron and a price target of $160. To summarize, the Street is cautiously optimistic about Chevron, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys and eight Holds. Following a 44.8% rally in the stock so far this year, the average Chevron price target of $164.63 implies a downside potential of 3.12% from current levels. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) ConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading exploration and production companies, with operations in 14 countries. It became an upstream pure-play following the spin-off of its downstream business in 2012 to create the independent company Phillips 66 (PSX). ConocoPhillips is known for its low-cost structure and efficiency. In its 4Q21 conference call, the company indicated that its free cash flow break-even point is around $30 per barrel. Meanwhile, higher realized prices and volumes helped ConocoPhillips generate revenue of $48.3 billion in 2021, up 151% from 2020. The company posted adjusted EPS of $6.01 in 2021 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $0.97 in 2020. Improved business conditions helped ConocoPhillips generate operating cash flows of $17 billion in 2021, up from $4.8 billion in 2020. The company continues to dispose of non-core assets as part of its ongoing efforts to focus on “low cost of supply opportunities.” Last month, ConocoPhillips completed the sale of its Indonesia assets to MedcoEnergi for about $1.36 billion. ConocoPhillips expects capital spending of $7.2 billion in 2022, up from $5.3 billion in 2021. Capital expenditure this year includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, and investments in early-stage low-carbon opportunities.    Further, the company expects to return $8 billion to shareholders in 2022, reflecting a 30% increase over 2021. These payments include an ordinary dividend per share of $0.46 and a second-quarter variable return of cash (VROC) payment of $0.30. On March 31, Mizuho analyst Vincent Lovaglio increased his long-term oil price forecast to $70 per barrel from $61, with his 2022-25 estimates up $16 per barrel on average, driven by an increase in estimated U.S. unconventional oil volume growth and the resulting increase in capital intensity. Given the increase in the price deck, Lovaglio raised his price targets for exploration and production companies, including ConocoPhillips stock to $150 from $115. Lovaglio reiterated a Buy rating on ConocoPhillips. On TipRanks, ConocoPhillips scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and three Holds. The average ConocoPhillips price target of $116.50 suggests 13.05% upside potential from current levels. The stock has advanced about 43% year-to-date.   Conclusion Shares of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have had an impressive run so far this year and have outperformed the broader market. However, Wall Street analysts are more bullish on ConocoPhillips and see higher upside potential from current levels. Discover new investment ideas with data you can trust.

1711,"Phillips 66 (PSX) was separated from ConocoPhillips (COP) back in 2011 in order for the latter to separate its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company. Phillips 66's four core segments include refining, midstream, chemicals, and marketing.



The company suffered last year along with its industry peers following the struggles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its recovery has been very strong due to the growing demand for oil. While I remain cautious when it comes to allocating capital in the oil majors, Phillips 66's diversified operations and strong capital returns offer a noteworthy margin of safety.



Specifically, the company's 5.18% yield seems well-covered and can provide robust capital returns in the current low-yield environment that investors, especially income-oriented ones, are likely to appreciate. 



Further, Phillips 66 is a more defensive pick than pure refiners during the ongoing pandemic. The company's minor loss of ($0.89) per share last year demonstrates its qualities compared to the massive losses some of its industry peers posted during the same period.



Further, Phillips 66 recently announced that it had agreed to acquire all publicly held common units in Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) that it does not already own in an all-stock deal. The unitholders of PSXP will receive 0.5 shares of Phillips 66 for each unit of PSXP they own.



The exchange is expected to close in Q1 of 2022, and as Phillips 66's management mentioned, the deal should unlock operating efficiencies and simplify the parent company's corporate structure. 



PSXP is a highly profitable and stable business too, which should further contribute to the parent company's profitability expansion. As a result, I am bullish on the stock. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Profitability and the Dividend



Phillips 66's Q3 2021 results showcased significant improvements. The company's refining margins more than doubled quarter-over-quarter following growing demand for oil products. The segment posted an adjusted profit of $184 million compared to an adjusted pre-tax loss of -$706 million in the previous quarter. 



Midstream, chemicals, and marketing, also posted strong numbers, resulting in the company quadrupling its EPS quarter-over-quarter, from $0.74 to $3.18



Based on the company's performance during the first nine months of the year and current market fundamentals, the company should be able to deliver EPS of around $4.25 for the full year. Further analysts expect EPS to grow by nearly 63% next year, and while oil prices are speculative, this is a testament to Phillips' 66 robust assets and strong recovery performance.



As far as the dividend goes, the company has increased it annually every year since the spin-off from ConocoPhillips, now counting nine years of sequential annual DPS hikes. The latest increase by 2.2% this past October may be humble, but it speaks volumes to the company's strong operating cash flows and management's commitment to meaningful shareholder capital returns. The annual DPS rate of $3.68 should be well-covered by the underlying EPS, while the 5.18% dividend yield is certainly enticing.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Phillips 66 has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. At $93.00, the average Phillips 66 price target implies 30.1% upside potential.

1721,"As part of its restructuring plan, ConocoPhillips (COP), the American multinational corporation engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production, has inked two deals to focus on the Asia-Pacific segment of its diverse global portfolio.



First Agreement



Under the first agreement signed for $1.355 billion, the company will vend its subsidiary that indirectly owns the company’s 54% interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC), and a 35% shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company, to MedcoEnergi. The deal, which is subject to customary adjustments, is likely to close in early 2022.



For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Indonesia assets to be sold recorded production of around 50 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). Additionally, it had year-end 2020 proved reserves of around 85 million barrels of oil equivalent. 



Second Agreement



Through its Australian subsidiary, ConocoPhillips will exercise its preemption right to buy an additional 10% shareholding interest in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) from Origin Energy for $1.645 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 and awaits Australian government approval, will be funded from cash on the balance sheet.



APLNG is a supplier of LNG to long-term buyers in both China and Japan and is currently the largest supplier of natural gas to Australia’s East coast domestic market.



Currently, the ConocoPhillips subsidiary currently holds a 37.5% APLNG shareholding stake, which would increase to 47.5% upon the closing of the deal, if the other relevant APLNG shareholder does not exercise its preemption rights.



Notably, the company’s production from APLNG was about 115 MBOED for 2020, and distributions are expected to be around $750 million for 2021, excluding distributions from additional shareholding interest.



CEO Comments



ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said, “Today’s announcement reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our company across every aspect of our global portfolio. The Asia Pacific region plays an important role in our diversification advantage as an independent E&P and these two transactions enhance that advantage by lowering our aggregate decline rate and diversifying our product mix.” 



Wall Street's Take



On December 7, Mizuho Securities analyst Vincent Lovaglio maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $101 (36.28% upside potential) on the stock. 



ConocoPhillips shares have rallied 73.6% over the past year. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average ConocoPhillips price target of $91.56 implies 23.55% upside potential to current levels.



ConocoPhillips' goes ex-div on December 31, 2021. The company is expected to pay a $0.20 dividend on January 14, 2022, reflecting a dividend yield of 2.36%. For more information on dividends, check out the U.S. dividend calendar on TipRanks.



Smart Score



ConocoPhillips scores an 8 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)

1882,"Texas-based Conocophillips (COP) is a global oil and gas company with operations in 14 countries. It has $87 billion in assets and a workforce of 9,900 people. Conocophillips recently agreed to acquire Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDS.A) assets in Texas for $9.5 billion in cash.

With this in mind, we used TipRanks to take a look at the newly added risk factors for Conocophillips. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)
Q3 Financial Results
Conocophillips reported revenue of $11.62 billion for Q3 2021, compared to $4.38 billion in the same quarter last year. It posted adjusted EPS of $1.77 against an adjusted loss per share of $0.31 in the same quarter last year, and beat the consensus estimate of adjusted EPS of $1.39.

The company plans to return $6 billion to shareholders in 2021 in dividends and share repurchases. It has paid out $4 billion year-to-date on those programs. During Q3, Conocophillips made a $0.5 billion deposit toward the Shell assets purchase. It ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in cash.
Risk Factors
Conocophillips carries 39 risk factors, according to the new TipRanks Risk Factors tool. The company recently updated its risk profile with seven new risk factors related to the pending acquisition of Shell’s assets in Texas.

Conocophillips has cautioned investors that the Shell deal is subject to a number of conditions that could prevent it from closing the transaction or delay the closing. The company says that if the Shell deal collapses, it could lose the deposit it has made toward the acquisition. The company has told investors that if closing of the Shell transaction delays, it could fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.

Even if it succeeds to acquire Shell’s assets, Conocophillips warns that integrating the assets into its system may be more difficult than anticipated. As a result, costs associated with the acquisition may increase and the company may fail to realize the benefits it expects.

Most of Conocophillips’ risk factors come under the Finance and Corporate category, with 46% of the total risks. That is above the sector average of 37%.


Analysts’ Take
Following Conocophillips’ Q3 earnings report, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a Buy rating on Conocophillips stock with a price target of $98. Hanold’s price target suggests 30.1% upside potential.

Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buys and two Holds. The average Conocophillips price target of $91.63 implies 21.5% upside potential to current levels.

2127,"It has been a volatile September with the market experiencing some painful dips. Nevertheless, zoom out and the past year charts show strong growth, with all the main indexes still hovering near all-time highs.



The large caps’ performance has been robust and has driven the main indexes’ gains. As such, several heavyweight stocks currently sit at or very near 12-month or even all-time highs.



The question here is: is it wise to invest in names which have already accrued big share gains over the past year? It could be, if more growth is anticipated in the months ahead by those in the know. 



With this in mind, we pulled up three such heavyweight stocks from the TipRanks database whose share prices not only sit at near yearly peaks, but which are also projected to keep pushing forward in the coming months. Even better, all three are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s take a deeper look.  



Salesforce (CRM)



Salesforce is a well-known name in cloud software, as the company was an early leader in the CRM niche – in fact, it took its ticker from its Customer Relationship Management products. Salesforce’s cloud-based software products provide solutions for the customer-facing issues businesses face: tracking sales and commerce, managing databases, customer service, market analytics. A major selling point is scalability; Salesforce software can work with companies of all sizes.



With a market cap just under $270 billion, this stock sits firmly in the mega-cap territory, and in fact, its share price is currently nesting at its highest ever peak.



The share gains reflect real-world success, as exhibited by the latest quarterly results for F2Q22. Revenue increased by 24.3% year-over-year to $6.34 billion, coming in ahead of the estimates by $90 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.48 also beat the Street’s $0.92 forecast.



With recent new additions to the leadership team and the Q2 closing of the $27.7 billion acquisition of workplace collaboration software maker Slack, one of Wall Street’s top analysts, Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin, has been paying attention.



“In-person conversations with new leadership give us confidence we could see a multi-year period of multiple and profit expansion tied to operating discipline and organic investments that can sustain growth... The new team, new model, and new post-COVID reality point to a structural change that could result in a material boost to profits as it scales revenue to $50B+… Both growth and margin expansion could become a more permanent and durable component of the CRM model going forward,” Bracelin opined.



Accordingly, Bracelin rates CRM an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $365 price target, suggesting upside of a further 34% from current levels. (To watch Bracelin’s track record, click here)



Bracelin is by no means alone in his positive stance. Of the 37 reviews on record, while 6 say Hold, 31 are to Buy, culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. With a return potential of nearly 17%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $318.63. (See CRM stock analysis on TipRanks)







Analog Devices (ADI)



Analog Devices is a world-renowned name in the semiconductor industry, where practically the whole gamut of electronic equipment has need for the company’s high-performance analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs). This is a company with a $92 billion market cap, almost 16,000 employees and a global footprint; More than 100,000 customers worldwide use ADI’s signal processing, data conversion, and power management tech.



In F3Q21, ADI generated revenue of $1.76 billion, a 20.5% increase on the same period last year and $50 million above Street expectations. The bottom-line delivered a beat too, as adjusted EPS of $1.72 came in ahead of the analysts’ forecast by $0.11.



Furthermore, the company has recently closed a big acquisition. At the end of August ADI finalized the deal to bring Maxim Integrated Products on board, in a purchase costing the company $21 billion - its biggest ever buy.



ADI share price sits near all-time highs, with the past 12 months delivering to investors returns of 50%. The solid performance has caught the eye of J.P. Morgan’s Harlan Sur, who sees the company in a sound position.



Explaining his stance following the Maxim deal, the 5-star analyst wrote: “Amidst a strong demand environment, we expect Analog Devices to drive strong execution of achieving synergies as the team has done so with prior acquisitions. The combined company is set to benefit from the positive macro demand fundamentals and with improved positioning in automotive (e.g., GMSL high speed data serial link and EV battery management) wired communications, and datacenter markets (e.g., processor/compute acceleration power management for customers like NVIDIA and Google).”



To this end, Sur rates ADI an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $215 price target. This figure implies ~25% upside from current levels. (To watch Sur’s track record, click here)



Overall, ADI has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 13 recent reviews breaking down to 10 Buys and 3 Holds. Shares are priced at $171.29, and the average price target, at $192.09 implies an upside potential of 12%. (See ADI stock analysis on TipRanks)







Conocophillips (COP)



Conocophillips is another industry leader, this time in the oil and gas sector, boasting a market cap of $91 billion. Based on production and proved reserves, ConocoPhillips is the world’s biggest independent E&P (exploration & production) company. It is also Alaska's largest crude oil producer and largest owner of exploration leases, and numbers 10,300 employees and operations in 15 countries.



For 2Q21, the company posted clock adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion - or $1.27 per share, well ahead of the $1.10 consensus estimate and the company’s best performance since 2018. It is also a significant turnaround from the $1 billion adjusted loss the company recorded a year-ago. 



Acquisitions have been high on the COP agenda, with the company’s recent purchase of Shell’s Permian assets expected to make it the world’s top shale basin’s second-largest producer. The deal should close in Q4 with a $9.5 billion price tag and follows on from the $13.3 billion acquisition of Concho Resources, which closed back in January.



Looking at the Shell deal, Raymond James’ John Freeman believes investors are in good hands here.



“Forecasted 2022E production comes in at ~1.75 MMBoe/d with estimated capex of ~$7.1B, which is up roughly $700M from our pre-acquisition model,” the 5-star analyst said. “Overall, this accretive transaction directly benefits shareholders, increasing COP’s 10-year distribution and free cash flow targets while further solidifying the company’s extensive, low-cost L48 asset base. As such, Conoco remains one of our top picks.”



In line with these comments, Freeman sets a Strong Buy rating on COP shares, with a $90 price target to suggest an upside of ~33% for the coming year. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)



Looking at the consensus breakdown, only one analyst is currently sitting on the COP sidelines, with all 18 other recent reviews saying Buy. Accordingly, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, backed by a $80.63 average price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~19% from current levels.
