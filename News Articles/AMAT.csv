539,"Apart from some prime banks releasing their results, it was the industrial production data that caught investors’ attention last week. Issued by the Federal Reserve, this metric gives an insight into the industrial output of the United States and the health of the U.S. economy. The recent data, released on Friday, reveals that the industrial production in the U.S. advanced 5.5% year-over-year in March. The metric expanded 3.3% in January and 7.5% in February.

Promising Picks Using the TipRanks Stock Screener tool, we have selected three stocks from the industrial goods sector that have a market capitalization of $10 billion to $200 billion, a ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Score, and carry either a Strong Buy or Moderate Buy consensus rating. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) The $100.1-billion company provides software solutions, equipment, and services necessary for the making of advanced displays and chips. It is headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. In February, Applied Materials’ President and CEO, Gary Dickerson, said, “Our outlook for 2022 and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher and Applied’s broad technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets.” For the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 (ending April 2022), the company anticipates net sales to be $6.35 billion, +/-$300 million, and adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) to be within the $1.75-$2.05 per share range. Five days ago, Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank reiterated a Buy rating on Applied Materials while lowering the price target to $145 (27.91% upside potential) from $180. The analyst opines that the semiconductor capital equipment companies will continue to sound bullish on demand despite ongoing supply constraints. Presently, Applied Materials has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and four Holds. Applied Materials’ average price forecast of $172.93 suggests 52.55% upside potential from the current level. Over the past year, shares of Applied Materials have declined 13.4%. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE: CP) The transcontinental freight services provider is based in Calgary, Canada. It transports coal, sulphur, grain, metals, and other commodities. Over the past year, shares of this $71-billion company have increased 4.5%. In January, the company’s President and CEO, Keith Creel, said that solid demand, economic strength, and unique initiatives have well-positioned Canadian Pacific “to drive profitable growth” for shareholders, customers, and employees. “These factors, coupled with the progression of our proposed combination with Kansas City Southern, position CP for another history-making year,” he added. Recently, Wells Fargo analyst Allison Poliniak maintained a Buy rating on Canadian Pacific while increasing the price target to $88 (15.21% upside potential) from $87. The company has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys and four Holds. Canadian Pacific’s average price target is $84.62, suggesting 10.79% upside potential from current levels. Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE: CSL) Based in Scottsdale, AZ, the $12.7-billion company manufactures and supplies engineered products to be used by original equipment manufacturers. It also supplies products for aftermarket customers. Shares of this company surged 38% last year. In February, the Chairman, President, and CEO of Carlisle Companies, D Christian Koch, said, “With all of our segments trending positively both from a demand and operational perspective, Carlisle is well positioned to drive continued profitable growth in 2022 and beyond."" Recently, Timothy Wojs of Robert W. Baird maintained a Buy rating on Carlisle Companies with a price target of $300 (22.80% upside potential). Carlisle Companies presently has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on six Buys and two Holds. Carlisle Companies’ price forecast of $282 mirrors 15.44% upside potential from current levels.

1114,"Applied Materials (AMAT) provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software, mainly to the semiconductor and display industries. The company delivers products and services that enhance device performance, yield, and cost.



Applied’s semiconductor segment, the company's primary revenue source, develops, manufactures, and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits (ICs). It includes semiconductor capital equipment used for many steps of the chip-making process, such as the transfer of patterns into device structures, metrology, inspection and review, and packaging technologies for connecting finished ICs.



Following the constantly growing demand for semiconductors and the ongoing supply chain crisis which has disrupted their supply and distribution, Applied Materials enjoys strong pricing power. Therefore, the  company is likely to keep expanding its top and bottom line, going forward at a rapid pace. That said, investors should be wary of Applied's current valuation, as the company's business model could be subject to the industry's well-known cyclicality.



Latest Results



Applied Materials reported its Q4-2021 results around a month ago, with total revenues coming in at $6.12 billion, growing 31% year-over-year. EPS was $1.94 on an adjusted basis, 55% higher year-over-year.



FY-2021 operating margin was 31.7% on an adjusted basis and 33.1% in Q4, suggesting improvement towards the end of the year. Specifically, semiconductor revenues grew 40% to $4.3 billion, and Applied Global Services revenue came in at $1.37 billion, 24% higher compared to last year. However, Display and Adjacent Markets saw revenues decline 14% to $417 million.



Despite the company's impressive growth metrics, investors were mostly underwhelmed with management's guidance, which resulted in shares declining post-earnings.



For Q1-2022, Applied anticipates net sales to be approximately $6.16 billion, plus or minus $250 million, which contains the predicted impact from the current supply chain challenges. Non-GAAP-adjusted diluted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.92. However, in my view, Applied's guidance is rather strong, as it still implies year-over-year revenue and EPS growth of 19.3% and 33%, respectively.



Dividend & Valuation 



Applied Materials has never cut its dividend since initiating payments in 2005. While there have been years with no dividend increases, Applied has grown its dividend for four consecutive years now. The latest hike was by 9% to a quarterly rate of $0.24. Applied's upcoming dividends,  beginning March 2022, should also see a hike, based on Applied's Material's dividend history of growing the dividend around March.







Based on management's Q1 outlook and consensus estimates, Applied's EPS for FY2022 should land around $8.12. This implies a (forward) P/E of 18.75. While the company is growing rapidly, and its bottom line is likely to expand even faster than revenues amid expanding margins, I feel that this is a steep multiple for the stock. Due to the risks attached to cyclical companies, I believe that a P/E between 12-15 would be much more reasonable and would provide investors with a higher margin of safety. For this reason, I am neutral on the stock. 



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, Applied Materials has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 12 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months.



At $171.07, Applied Materials stock projections suggest a 10.02% upside potential.

1240,"Materials engineering solutions provider Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) reported weaker-than-expected Q4 results due to ongoing supply chain challenges. Shares of the company were down 5.1% during an extended trading session on November 18.



The company also provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 below the analyst expectations.



Q4 Performance Misses Expectations



The company's adjusted earnings of $1.94 per share grew 55% year-over-year, but fell a cent short of analysts’ expectations of $1.95 per share. AMAT reported earnings of $1.25 per share in the prior-year period.



Net sales jumped 31% year-over-year to $6.12 billion, but fell short of the analysts' estimates of $6.34 billion. During the fourth quarter, the company stated that its Semiconductor Systems' backlog grew from $5.5 billion to $6.7 billion, and the company expects continued strength in 2022. 



Meanwhile, operating margin grew 480 bps to 33.1% against 28.3% in the prior-year quarter. (See Applied Materials stock chart on TipRanks)



Guidance Below Expectations



Based on the continued impact of the ongoing supply chain challenges, management provided the financial guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.



The company forecasts adjusted earnings in the range of $1.78 per share to $1.92 per share, lower than the consensus estimate of $2.01 per share. Revenues are forecast to be $6.16 billion with a possible variation of plus or minus $250 million, against the consensus estimate of $6.5 billion.



See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>



Management Weighs In



AMAT CEO, Gary Dickerson, commented, “Demand for semiconductors and equipment continues to grow as the pandemic accelerates digital transformation of the economy, and currently, our supply chain cannot keep up.”



He further added, “We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near-term, and managing these constraints in partnership with our suppliers and chipmakers is our top priority.”



Wall Street’s Take



Following the Q4 results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating with the price target of $161 (1.4% upside potential).



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Applied Materials price target of $161.45 implies 1.7% downside potential.
