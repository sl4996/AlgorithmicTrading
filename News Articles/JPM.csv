2026,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is one of the most prominent financial institutions in the U.S., boasting more than $3.0 trillion in assets under management. The company's international operations comprise Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. JPMorgan is also by far the largest diversified bank in the U.S. by market cap. The company is valued at around $370 billion, with Bank of America (BAC), the second-largest diversified bank, worth around $313 billion. JPMorgan's investment case is distinguished from that of its peers due to its numerous competitive advantages. These include the bank's massive scale, diversified cash flows, and world-class reputation. I have historically seen JPMorgan as a quality investment, as it features growth, rich qualities, and vigorous capital returns. Following the stock's correction year-to-date, JPMorgan shares have become rather attractive. While its Q1 results appeared weaker compared to last year amid the excessive release of net credit reserves at the time, the bank's bottom-line prospects for the year remain rock solid. Further, management's new capital return program should positively impact the bank's per-share earnings, which, combined with the possibility for a valuation expansion, make JPMorgan's investment thesis rather tempting. I remain bullish on JPMorgan. Declining Earnings are Not Worrisome  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, JPMorgan reported revenues of $30.7 billion, a 5% decline year-over-year. Additionally, net income came in at $8.3 billion, declining by a much more substantial 42% during this period. However, this quarter's results need some context. Specifically, last year's earnings of all banks were boosted dramatically by reserve releases, resulting in net income levels almost doubling year-over-year at the time. Most bank balance sheets strengthened in 2021 due to the release of COVID-era credit loss allowances, which include the reserves financial institutions amassed since the pandemic started to absorb the possible scenario of some borrowers being incapable of meeting their debt obligations. In Q1, JPMorgan reported a net credit reserve build of $902 million compared to a net credit reserve release of $5.2 billion in the comparable period last year. Thus, the massive net income decline is only synthetic and should not spur unnecessary worries. Overall, Q1 results were rather mixed. On the one hand, in Consumer & Community Banking, deposits grew 18% while client investment assets rose 9%, primarily boosted by positive net flows. Combined debit and credit card spending also increased 21% as JPMorgan continues to see a revival in credit card spending, specifically when it comes to travel and dining. On the other hand, card loan balances grew 11% but were still below pre-COVID levels. While auto loans also grew by 3%, the scarcity of vehicle supply kept limiting originations, which declined by 25%. Clearly, the current economic environment has grown market uncertainty on multiple fronts. The goal of JPMorgan this year should be to minimize the damage of the current global turmoil to the company and its clients alike instead of maximizing profitability like last year. However, investors need to recognize that Fiscal 2022 should still be a rather profitable year for the company considering the overall circumstances. Wall Street analysts expect the company to deliver EPS of $11.18 for the year, implying a decline of around 26.9% versus Fiscal 2021 due to the aforementioned reasons. Still, this implies a robust 25.7% growth compared to Fiscal 2020, which illustrates the positive earnings growth trajectory excluding last year's reserve release. Huge Buybacks to Boost Per-Share Metrics Assuming the current drivers of global economic uncertainty start fading from Fiscal 2023, JPMorgan's earnings growth should resume from next year. However, the company's massive buybacks alone should have an accretive effect on its per-share metrics. The company has a long history of large buyback programs. Last year, JPMorgan repurchased around $18.4 billion worth of its common stock. In its most recent quarter, buybacks amounted to $1.7 billion, while the board has now authorized a new share repurchase program of $30 billion, effective May 1st, 2022. This equals about 8% of JPMorgan's current market capitalization, which should suggest that the company will be retiring a significant amount of its common stock in the short-to-medium term. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, JPMorgan has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $162.43, the average JPMorgan price target implies 27.3% upside potential. Takeaway  JPMorgan shares have declined substantially from their 52-week lows amid elevated uncertainty following the ongoing global turmoil. While the sell-off has not been entirely unjustifiable, it appears to me that shares could be rather attractively priced at their current levels. Despite what looks like a substantial earnings drop in its most recent results, a drop is only natural following last year's reserve release. Despite that, JPMorgan should still end the year with notably higher profits than its pre-COVID levels. Combined with the new repurchase program, which should significantly boost investors' total capital return yield along with the current 3.17% dividend yield, JPMorgan offers value with a relatively wide margin of safety.

2291,"2021 was a fantastic year for banking stocks, but the momentum did not carry over into 2022. Due to a number of issues, this year got off to a shaky start. Recessionary fears were stoked by growing inflation, supply-chain imbalances, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy. Market sentiment has been impaired by these fears, which have touched practically all sectors, including the financial industry. Despite signs of rising interest rates, banking stocks have lost steam this year. In the first quarter, the benchmark KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which covers 24 of the major U.S. lenders, fell more than 11%. Q1 Could Be a Big Blow Banks could produce weaker-than-expected results in the first quarter. It is most likely that Q1 earnings from some of the largest U.S. banks may show that rising cost pressures might have hurt their margins. Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor said, “For the first quarter, year over year, we were probably expecting capital markets revenue to be down like 10 to 20 percent [at the start of 2021], as a range across the banks. And now we’re down 30-50 percent. It’s pretty materially weaker.” Notably, fourth-quarter earnings released in January fell short of expectations, with several banks warning that spending will continue to rise this year, putting pressure on margins. With the banking sector's first-quarter earnings just around the corner, investors will be looking at how the banks performed and what lies ahead. The spotlight this week will be on the quarterly results of the so-called ""Big 5 Banks"" — JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Year-to-Date Performance The ""Big 5 Banks"", which were expected to benefit from interest rate hikes, have performed poorly so far this year and are all trading in the red year-to-date. The price-performance of these banking stocks is depicted in the graph below. JPMorgan JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States by assets, has recently been expanding through acquisitions. The company is creating branches in new areas to broaden its reach. The plan will help the bank capture cross-selling opportunities by expanding its footprint in the card and vehicle loan sectors, in addition to gaining market share. Aside from that, the company continues to expand its investment banking and asset management businesses in China. For the upcoming Q1 results, analysts expect JPMorgan to announce adjusted earnings of $2.72 per share, a fall of 40% year-over-year. Overall, JPMorgan stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on nine Buys, six Holds, and one Sell. As for price targets, the average JPM price target of $171.19 implies almost 28.7% upside potential from current levels. Citigroup Citigroup has been focusing on core business growth while streamlining its processes globally. The corporation continues to optimize its branch network while also attempting to streamline operations and reduce costs. The company's earnings have outperformed analysts' projections for the last seven quarters. For the upcoming quarter, analysts estimate Citigroup to report adjusted earnings of $1.43 per share, a fall of 60% year-over-year. For 2022, total revenues are expected to grow in the low single digits, excluding divestitures. Higher interest rates and higher fees are anticipated to drive this growth. On TipRanks, Citigroup stock sports a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. As for price targets, the average C price target of $70.88 implies almost 40.2% upside potential from current levels. Goldman Sachs Goldman’s bottom line in the upcoming quarter could be impacted by its expanding cost base. Furthermore, in the March-end quarter, headwinds were produced by a reduction in the investment banking business due to depressed capital markets and increased market volatility triggered by the Ukraine conflict. For the upcoming first quarter, analysts estimate Goldman to report adjusted earnings of $9.07 per share, a fall of 51% year-over-year. Also, we used TipRanks' new online tool to track user visits to its website. Surprisingly, the company's monthly user numbers came out to be quite encouraging. The tool showed that overall projected visits to the Goldman Sachs website increased in Q1. In particular, the total projected worldwide visits to the GS website increased by 38% from the fourth quarter of 2021. On TipRanks, Goldman Sachs stock sports a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buy and five Hold recommendations. As for price targets, the average GS price target of $434.36 implies almost 35.4% upside potential from current levels. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley has been working on a number of initiatives to restructure its operations in order to increase stable revenue streams. The corporation had a wonderful year in 2021, with record earnings and significant capital returns to its stockholders. Further, the company's earnings have outperformed analysts' projections for the last seven quarters. For the upcoming earnings quarter, analysts estimate Morgan Stanley to report adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share, a fall of 22% year-over-year. However, the current market volatility has created a panic among investors. According to TipRanks' Stock Investors tool, investors currently have a Very Negative view of Morgan Stanley, with 1.4% of investors decreasing their exposure to MS stock over the past 30 days. On TipRanks, Morgan Stanley stock sports a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buy and six Hold recommendations. The average MS stock price target of $105.11 implies almost 25% upside potential from current levels. Wells Fargo The company's deposit base continues to grow. The deposit balance is projected to improve more as the economy improves, notably in the consumer business and commercial banking divisions. The bank's liquidity should be bolstered as a result of this. For the upcoming first quarter, analysts estimate Wells Fargo to report adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share, a fall of 23% year-over-year. We used TipRanks' new online tool to track user visits to its website. The company's monthly user numbers remained disappointing. The tool showed that overall projected visits to the Wells Fargo website decreased in Q1. In particular, the total projected worldwide visits to wellsfargo.com decreased by 13% sequentially from the fourth quarter. On TipRanks, Wells Fargo stock sports a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buy and four Hold recommendations. The average WFC stock price target of $60.37 implies almost 22% upside potential from the current levels. Bottom Line As banks strive to contain expenses in an inflationary environment, the approaching earnings season for banks could be a mixed bag for investors. The dangers have definitely increased as a result of the Russia/Ukraine war and a larger likelihood of recession as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to combat inflation. Nonetheless, the banks have several potential tailwinds, including increased interest rates and a faster-growing loan environment.

The bank said it sees companies of all shapes and sizes entering the metaverse, including household names like Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). “It is difficult to base a business strategy on such a dynamic space, characterized by explosive growth and the continuous innovation of new entrants. However, the costs and risks of engaging early and consistently in order to build internal intellectual property, develop hypotheses about future business models, and identify ecosystem partners and collaborators are relatively low,” the report indicated. “The asymmetrical risk of being left behind is worth the incremental investment needed to get started and to explore this new digital landscape for yourself,” JPMorgan added.

A Quick Look at Some Upcoming Releases



Let’s see what’s in the offing for these three big bank stocks – JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) – that are scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2021 results on January 14.



The chart below shows a comparison of the price performance of these bank stocks.







JPMorgan



JPMorgan's third-quarter 2021 earnings of $3.74 per share were driven by strength in the advisory business, reserve release, and a minor increase in loan demand.



For the upcoming Q4 quarter, analysts predict JPMorgan will announce adjusted earnings of $3 per share, a fall of 20.8% year-over-year.







Also, the firm pays a dividend with a current yield of 2.27%.



On the analyst side, Societe Generale analyst Andrew Lim downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold and decreased the price target to $175 from $195, citing weaker net interest income estimates. Lim believes JPMorgan's stock is ""expensive"" at present levels, and that net interest income would continue to remain weak in the upcoming quarter.



Overall, JPMorgan stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, based on 11 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. As for price targets, the average JPM stock price prediction of $180.80 implies almost 8% upside potential from the current levels.



Citigroup 



Citigroup posted strong earnings of $2.15 per share in the third quarter, above analysts' estimates by 44 cents, thanks to robust results in investment banking (IB) and strength in stock markets.



The company's earnings have outperformed analysts' projections for the last four quarters. For the upcoming earnings quarter, analysts estimate Citigroup to report adjusted earnings of $1.52 per share, a fall of 26.9% year-over-year.







Citigroup has the highest dividend yield among the three stocks, at 3.1%. In a higher-interest-rate environment, investors may choose companies with better dividend yield, which might enhance stock prices.



The omicron version has undoubtedly caused some uncertainty in the short term, and analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays appears to be concerned about it. As a result, he maintained an Equal Weight (Neutral) rating on Citigroup and lowered the price objective to $73 per share from $86.



Bank stocks, on the other hand, are expected to continue to outperform the market in 2022, according to Goldberg. He anticipates loan growth to accelerate, with rising interest rates benefiting net interest margins.



On TipRanks, Citigroup stock sports a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 8 Buy and 7 Hold recommendations. As for price targets, the average C stock price prediction of $79.09 implies almost 18% upside potential from the current levels.



Wells Fargo 



Wells Fargo delivered strong Q3 results, thanks to the improving economic environment. The company’s growing deposit balance should continue to strengthen Wells Fargo’s liquidity position.



Looking ahead into the Q4 quarter, the majority of experts believe that the stock is now an excellent investment. They expect Wells Fargo to report adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share. This would represent a 70.3% increase in profits on a year-over-year basis.







Wells Fargo pays a dividend as well, although it's the smallest of the three at only 1.09%.



However, there is only one analyst, Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan, who chooses to remain on the sidelines for the time being on this stock.



Juneja does expect, however, that banks should begin 2022 on a ""good note,"" owing to a strong increase in commercial and industrial loan growth in late Q4. Furthermore, stronger loan growth in the near future and Fed rate rises in the medium term should provide banks with a ""double benefit"" in 2022. As a consequence, Juneja raised his price target to $57.00 from $53.50, albeit while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock.



The rest of the Wall Street analysts have given Wells Fargo a Moderate Buy consensus recommendation, with 15 recent ratings, including 11 Buys and 4 Holds. The company is now trading at $56.06, with an average WFC price target of $56.62 implying 1% gain from that point.



Bottom Line



Currently, Citigroup appears to be the best bet, owing to its double-digit upside potential over the next 12 months and the group's highest dividend yield of 3.1%.

Despite stringent regulations, China is one of the fastest-growing wealth markets worldwide. Therefore, one-fifth of total new hires by the bank are expected to focus on clients in mainland China. 



According to the source, the bank expanded aggressively in Asia in 2021 with 42 new Hong Kong-based employees catering to clients in China, bringing the total number of mainland staff to 80.



Currently, JPMorgan is focused on wealthy individuals in new economic sectors, including tech, biotech, and electric vehicles. The bank is targeting individuals with a minimum of $25 million in investable assets. 



Wall Street’s Take 



Yesterday, Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin maintained a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $192 (14.75% upside potential) from $198.  



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average JPMorgan price target of $180.80 implies 8.06% upside potential. Shares have gained 22.2% over the past year. 



JPMorgan is expected to release its upcoming earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2021 on January 14.

4225,"We can see that there is a genuine unease in the market at the start of the Q4 results season, as the Omicron strain of COVID-19 has spread and market volatility has edged higher, owing to rising rate fears.



These anticipated interest rate rises will be good news for a few industries, such as banking, but bad news for others, such as the construction industry, as interest hikes will raise borrowing costs.



In such a market scenario, investors are likely looking for quality picks to avoid being harmed by the continued selloff. Solid corporate earnings releases from large banks like Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) on January 14 may, however, boost investor optimism by the end of the week.



In light of this, TipRanks' Smart Score System is a great tool for investors, since it allows them to evaluate a company in greater depth.



This technique takes eight important factors into consideration, such as hedge fund and insider trading activity, and provides a score to the equities on a scale of 1 to 10. Stocks with a 'Perfect 10' score are more likely to outperform the market than those with a lower score. As a consequence, it supports investors in putting together a portfolio that will maximize returns.



Using TipRanks' Top Smart Score Stocks, we discovered two stocks that scored a ""Perfect 10"" on the Smart Score scale. Both these stocks also have a Strong Buy average rating.



Apple (AAPL)



Apple is a worldwide corporation that has received a ""Perfect 10"" rating for the past three days. The corporation is regarded as the most valuable in the world, with the highest brand loyalty.



Despite supply-chain worries, Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter 2021 earnings were excellent. Sales increased by 29% year-over-year to $83.4 billion. In addition, earnings of $1.24 per share were up 69.9% over the year-ago quarter. Apple's financials were driven by strong sales across all product categories.



On January 27, Apple is anticipated to release its upcoming earnings, which might function as a catalyst for the stock.



Looking ahead, the company should continue to thrive across all business segments, as noted by Citigroup analyst Jim Suva. Apple stock provides a variety of reasons for the analyst to stay positive.



First, Suva expects Apple to continue to expand its revenue, owing to robust iPhone demand and expansion in associated services. He also feels that the virtual/augmented reality business ""is poised for growth,"" and that Apple will profit from his upcoming hardware launches, which include a virtual/augmented reality headset. Suva goes on to say that Apple's aggressive approach of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases should continue to benefit the business.



As a consequence, Suva raised his price objective $200 from $170, implying about 16.2% rise in value from present levels.



Overall, the Apple stock forecast is a Strong Buy, according to consensus from Wall Street analysts, with 26 recent assessments, including 21 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is now trading at $172.19 and the average AAPL price target of $175.28 implies around 1.8% upside from that level.







Sony Group (SONY)



Sony Group is another consumer electronics company that has achieved a ""Perfect 10"" in the last three days.



The Japanese multinational has a wide business portfolio that includes professional and consumer electronics manufacturing, film production, and gaming publishing.



Recently, Sony declared its ambition to enter the electric vehicle space with new products at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The business showed an SUV version of its VISION-S concept electric vehicle. Interestingly, Sony has formed a separate firm, Sony Mobility, to focus solely on electric vehicles. Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony's CEO, has stated that the company is ""exploring a commercial launch"" for its EV.



With the latest news in mind, Morgan Stanley analyst Masahiro Ono maintained his optimistic outlook on Sony and confirmed his Overweight rating.



According to Ono, Sony intends to influence the future of the mobility sector with sensor technology, 5G and cloud connection, and content that transforms the car interior into an entertainment zone. In the medium run, he expects these contributions to boost the company's profitability.



Overall, on TipRanks, Sony Group stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 3 unanimous Buys. The shares are priced at $123.17 and the average SONY price target of $150 implies around 21.8% upside from that level.

Stress Test Index Cohesion



Contrary to many opinions in the press, the financial markets are actually in a low-stress environment. The Stress Test Index currently trades below zero at -0.69, meaning that economic conditions are a lot less volatile than they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic when the index traded above the 5.00 mark.



Banking stocks tend to perform at their best during low-stress environments because of their interlinkages with the centralized economy. As inflation cools down in 2022, J.P. Morgan will experience less erosion of debt products and more predictable returns in the equity markets, adding balance to the firm-specific stress test.



Adding to the above, J.P. Morgan looked solid in its very own stress test back in June last year when the bank remained on course for a tier 1 equity ratio of 11.2% by 2023, well exceeding the threshold of 4.5%. J.P. Morgan's likely to experience high stock returns if it can continue to provide such strong firm-specific characteristics in a favorable market environment.



Breaking Down the Business Units



The big bank ranked second in M&A deal flow for 2021 with a 21.4% market share. A record $5 trillion in M&A deals were done in 2021, which J.P. Morgan benefitted from as one of the market leaders.



If we analyze the bank's latest earnings report, it's evident that it ended the year well. J.P Morgan had experienced exceptional growth in trading with its Q3 earnings report signaling 9% quarter-over-quarter growth of segment revenue. In fact, this happened during a period where the markets slowed down; it's thus a sign of the high level of skill held by the bank's traders.



Other key segments also ended the year well, with credit card purchases increasing 4% quarter-over-quarter, and period-end card balances improving by 1% during the same period of time.



Past results never guarantee future performance, but we can draw up a trajectory by using historical data, and the data at hand suggests that J.P. Morgan is on the up for 2022, with few obstacles in its way.



An Undervalued Stock



J.P Morgan stock is undervalued relative to its five-year average. Many believe that mean reversion isn't a valid reason for investment decisions, but this is a false narrative because cyclical stocks such as banks have shown time and time again that their ratios are mean-reverting.



According to J.P Morgan's GAAP P/E, its stock is undervalued by 23% with its PEG of 0.1, also indicating that the P/E ratio is lagging earnings per share growth.



Furthermore, J.P. Morgan stock is trading at a dividend yield discount of 7%, and many may not know this, but you can actually judge a stock's value based on its dividend yield if the payout ratio remains constant.



J.P Morgan will usually trade above sector averages with a Log of Unadjusted stock price and Return on Equity premiums worth 64.96%, and 52.64%, respectively; investors thus shouldn't value the stock relative to its sector peers but rather its own historical averages.



Wall Street's Take



Turning to Wall Street, JPM has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys, three Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. 



The average J.P. Morgan price target of $181.15 implies 8.3% upside potential.







Concluding Thoughts



The climate of the financial markets is well set for banking stocks to outperform other sectors. 



J.P Morgan stock could provide investors with better returns than its sector peers due to its market positioning, and historic trading premiums.

With interest rates set to rise, this steady-yielding income stock could outpace the market as it will benefit from higher yields. 



I am bullish on JPMorgan stock. 



Net Interest Income to Rise in 2022



Inflation is on the rise in the U.S., rising to nearly 7% in the last report. Because of this, interest rates will likely rise in 2022 faster than previously expected. This could help companies like JPMorgan to increase its net interest revenue. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve kept rates very low until 2018, when the average yield rose to 1.79%. 2019 was the recent high point with an average yield of 2.16%. After the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Federal Reserve again slashed rates to near zero. 



In 2018, with rates normalizing, JPMorgan grew its net interest revenue by 10%. This growth continued in 2019, gaining another 4%. Since the rate cut associated with the pandemic, net interest revenues are down over 5%. This could reverse course in 2022 and beyond as yields begin to rise. 



Overall revenues have climbed considerably over the trailing twelve months, as net charge-offs have come in lower than expected. When COVID-19 hit, the banks conservatively estimated future losses and took a significant income hit for fiscal 2020. Many of these charge-offs did not materialize; great news for JPMorgan and its investors. 



Because of this, the net margin has grown to 38% over the TTMs after falling to 29% in fiscal 2020. This should moderate in 2022, but investors should expect a healthy net margin well above 30%. 



Steady Yield Supported by Buybacks



JPMorgan has grown its dividend for 13 straight years. It now stands at $1.00 per quarter and yields around 2.4%. The payout ratio is very low, at 23.4%, making the dividend extremely safe. The dividend was last raised in Q3 2021. 







Over the TTMs, JPMorgan has also repurchased over $16 billion in stock. This amounts to nearly 3.5% of the current market cap. Stock repurchases support the share price and offer investors a tax-deferred return of capital. JPMorgan has been prolific at stock buybacks in recent years. 



The stock buyback also helps the valuation by reducing the share count and increasing earnings-per-share. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10. This is less than it was selling for before the pandemic. 



The stock also gained nearly 29% in 2021; this is a terrific performance on top of the steady dividend. These combined factors offer investors a compelling entry point for a stable yielding financial services company.



Wall Street Analysis



Over on Wall Street, analysts are somewhat bullish on JP Morgan stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. 



The average JPMorgan price target of $179.62 implies 13.4% upside potential. 



Looking to 2022



Inflation is a significant concern for investors as we head into 2022. With inflation comes higher interest rates. So why not look for stocks that have the potential to benefit from higher rates? That is the case with JPMorgan. Net interest revenue should rise along with yields. Coupled with the steady 2.4% yield and the support of stock buybacks, JPMorgan seems like a solid buy for 2022.

4783,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is a financial holding company whose global operations include consumer & community banking, corporate & investment banking, commercial banking, and asset & wealth management.



As of its latest filing, the company had around $3 trillion in assets under management (AUM). It's also by far the largest diversified bank in the U.S. in terms of market cap. Specifically, JPMorgan is worth nearly $500 billion, with Bank of America (BAC), the second-largest diversified bank, worth almost $400 billion.



JPMorgan's competitive advantages include its immense scale, diversified cash flow streams, and world-class reputation. In my view, its stock makes for a quality investment, offering growth, robust qualities, and strong capital returns while trading at a fair valuation. For these reasons, I am bullish on JPMorgan. (See Analysts' Top Stocks on TipRanks)



Q3 Results: Robust Financials 



JPMorgan's Q3 results were rather strong, with total revenues landing at $29.6 billion, 1.7% higher year-over-year, and in line with estimates. Markets revenues were relatively weak, with fixed income down -20%, but equity markets made up for this weakness, growing by 30% versus the prior-year period.



Average loans were also down -7% year-over-year, and -1% compared to the previous quarter. Still, average deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 19% year-over-year, more than offsetting this decline. 



Furthermore, average loans were $1 trillion while average deposits were $2.4 trillion, resulting in a comfortable loan-to-deposit ratio. JPMorgan also reported an ROE (return on equity) of 18% and ROTCE (return on tangible common equity) of 22%.



At the moment, rate hikes could be one of JPMorgan's principal growth opportunities going forward. The ongoing inflationary environment is tough for banks, as the U.S currently has a very low real rate, indicating potential rate increases by the Fed at some point. 



So far, the Fed has pointed towards low rates persisting. However, seeing the company performing strongly in such a pressuring environment should imply exciting prospects, assuming rates increase going forward.



Capital Returns and Valuation



JPMorgan has grown its capital returns consistently over the years. In addition, its dividend has increased annually for the last 11 consecutive years. The previous dividend per share hike was 11.1% in September. It also executes significant stock repurchases, adding to its total capital returns. 



It has bought back $16.2 billion worth of shares in the last twelve months alone. With a dividend yield of 2.5% and a ""buyback yield"" of around 4.3% based on the current quarterly run-rate of approximately $20.8 billion, the combined tangible returns investors are currently enjoying are quite sizeable.



Shares are trading at a forward P/E of approximately 14, which makes JPMorgan attractively priced, in my view, while its capital returns provide a nice margin of safety. Overall, JPMorgan remains a very well-run bank with a seasoned management team and a proven track record of solid shareholder value creation. 



Moreover, considering that the company performed well during the Pandemic, and future rate hikes could benefit its earnings, JPMorgan is well-positioned to continue to grow its record profitability levels. Hence, I remain confident in the stock's medium-term prospects.



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to Wall Street, JPMorgan has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $175.85, the average JPMorgan price target implies 7.4% upside potential.

With this in mind, let’s take a look at JPMorgan’s latest financial performance and risk factors. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)
Q3 Financial Results
JPMorgan reported revenue of $30.4 billion in the third-quarter of 2021. The figure stood at $29.9 billion in the same quarter last year. During the quarter, it posted earnings of $3.74 per share against $2.92 per share in the same quarter last year.

JPMorgan distributed $3 billion in dividends at an amount of $1 per share during the third quarter and spent $5 billion on share repurchases. (See JPMorgan Chase stock charts on TipRanks).
Risk Factors
According to the new TipRanks' Risk Factors tool, JPM's main risk categories are Finance & Corporate, Macro & Political and Legal & Regulatory, which account for 36%, 26% and 23%, respectively, of the total 47 risks identified for the stock. The company has recently updated one of its Macro and Political risk factors.

The company reminds investors that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to its business and operating results. Further, the company cautions investors that the actions taken by governments in response to the pandemic could adversely affect its business.

The Macro and Political risk factor's sector average is at 9%, compared to JPMorgan’s 26%. Shares of the company have gained about 29% year-to-date.


Analysts’ Take
On November 16, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $171. Schorr’s price target suggests 3.97% upside potential.

Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 10 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average JPMorgan Chase price target of $175.85 implies 6.92% upside potential.

Tesla is a U.S. company that designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric cars, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. The company also operates a network of vehicle service centers and supercharger stations. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)
JPMorgan's Claims
In the lawsuit, JPMorgan alleges that Tesla did not adhere to the terms of a contract pertaining to the re-pricing of the warrants in question. According to the lawsuit, the EV giant was supposed to deliver shares, or cash, on its share price moving above a set strike price by a certain expiration date.

According to CNBC, the lawsuit stems back to 2018 when Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he was planning to take the company private for $420 but rescinded the idea a few weeks later. JPMorgan alleges that it had a right to make adjustments to the warrants.
Tesla’s Defense
In the complaint, JPMorgan insists that Tesla failed to deliver 228,775 shares, leaving it with an open hedge position equal to a shortfall. Tesla, on its defense, insists that the adjustments were unreasonably swift, amounting to an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of Tesla stock volatility.
Stock Rating
Late last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated a Buy rating on Tesla stock with a $1,200 price target implying 14.7% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, Tesla is poised for higher vehicle sales in the coming years as it continues to demonstrate manufacturing leadership in the EV space.

Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 10 Buys, six Holds, and seven Sells. The average Tesla price target of $850.24 implies 18.7% downside potential to current levels.
