467,"The oldest advice in the markets is, buy low and sell high. The hardest trick in the markets is knowing how to recognize a low-cost stock that is poised to bring strong gains. It’s a trick because, in truth, low cost is a relative description. A stock can have a triple-digit price tag, and still be selling for a discount if it’s off a recent high point.



The upshot is, investors looking to buy low can use sharp declines in fundamentally sound stocks as a deciding factor. Wall Street’s analysts aren’t shy about pointing out deals in the market, and a review of their notes will point investors toward stocks that have hit a hurdle, lost share price, but retained the strengths that got them that peak in the first place.



We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up details on three stocks that meet this profile. These are an interesting lot, coming from several market niches, but all are Strong Buys with plenty of upside potential and they are all down at least 30% from peak values reached earlier this year. Let’s take a deeper dive in, and check them out.



Open Lending Corporation (LPRO)



First up is Open Lending, a loan financing company in the automotive sector. Financing has been the engine of car sales – for new and used – in recent years, and it will likely be more important going forward as inflation pushes up prices in the car markets. Open Lending, a Texas-based company, makes the decision process easy, with loan analytics, risk modeling and risk-based pricing, and automated decision making. The company went public last year through a SPAC transaction.



Open Lending works with automotive lending companies, offering a platform to streamline their lending process. The company’s services allow lenders to make the best use of their assets and to maximize the repayment rates. The result is lower risk and higher yields, a win for everyone, including the end customer who drives off in a newly purchased car.



Despite some volatility through 2021, the company’s stock generally stayed elevated – until September of this year, when it started falling form its peak. From that peak, the stock is down 43%.



Even though the stock is down, company management described the recent 3Q21 report as a ‘record.’ Revenue came in at $58.9 million, down slightly from the $61.1 million in 2Q21, but up an impressive 97% year-over-year. The company facilitated over 49,000 certified loans during the quarter, up  138% yoy. EPS was positive, at 23 cents per share, compared to the 62-cent EPS loss in the year-ago quarter.



Writing on this stock for Canaccord Genuity, 5-star analyst Joseph Vafi sees the company in a sound position despite inflationary headwinds. 



“Another all-time record quarter, bucking Covid, global chip shortages and rising car prices and underscoring how resilient the Open Lending platform is against such macro headwinds…. the LPRO business model is still expanding, with solid execution in credit union refi, potentially launching new products in the short term, and importantly moving forward with auto OEM relationships in addition to the two already in hand. Even during a tough quarter in auto transactions, the company signed 16 new customers, four of which had assets of $1B or greater,” Vafi noted.



To this end, Vafi gives LPRO shares a Buy rating, with a $55 price target that implies a 12-month upside potential of a huge 130%. (To watch Vafi’s track record, click here)



Overall, it’s clear that Wall Street likes the prospects on this stock. Of the 8 recent reviews, 7 are to Buy against 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $23.90, and the average price target of $38.57 suggests a gain of 61% in the year ahead. (See LPRO stock analysis at TipRanks)







Five9 (FIVN)



Next up is Five9, an AI cloud company offering a scalable contact center platform. Five9 has a smart product in a crowded industry, but online contact is a growth industry. The company’s software uses AI to allow faster data analysis with greater accuracy and efficiency. Contact center customers can use the AI to track and route calls, direct callers and service agents, and process information.



The big news recently on Five9 was the collapse of the company’s talks with Zoom. The two companies had been in negotiations over a Zoom offer to acquire Five9. The offer, for an all-stock deal, was worth $14.7 billion, but Five9’s shareholders rejected the deal on the last day of September. It is highly unusual for company shareholders to reject a merger deal in this fashion.



Five9’s stock, which had been volatile this year, had been slipping since its August peak. It fell further after the rejection of the Zoom offer; currently, FIVN shares are down 32% from that peak value.



Despite nixing Zoom’s offer in the third quarter, Five9 reported record revenue and beat the EPS estimates in the Q3 financial release. The company’s top line hit $154.3 million, up 38% yoy, and EPS, at 28 cents, was 12% better than the 25-cent forecast.



Terry Tillman, 5-star analyst with Truist, was impressed by Five9’s quarter – and by the company’s outlook going into next year. He writes, “FIVN returned to its regularly scheduled quarterly call without missing a beat. The company delivered record bookings in 3Q, and sounded confident about ongoing strong momentum in enterprise growth, while confirming 2026 revenue ($2.4 billion) and EBITDA margin (~23%) as potential targets laid out in recent SEC filings. Given the stock underperformance since the Zoom deal was terminated, we believe this is a good entry opportunity for investors as fundamental momentum remains strong.”



In line with his optimistic approach, Tillman gives LIFE shares a Buy rating and his $210 price target suggests a 48% potential upside for the coming year. (To watch Tillman’s track record, click here)



Like Tillman, Wall Street is confident on Five9’s prospects, and that can be seen in the 16 reviews on record. These break down to 14 Buys and just 2 Holds, to support the Strong Buy consensus. The average price target of $199.25 implies a one-year upside of 40% from the current trading price. (See FIVN stock analysis on TipRanks)







Annexon Biosciences (ANNX) 



The last stock we'll look at, Annexon, is a clinical-stage researcher, focused on C1q, an initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway – and one that is implicated in a number of auto-immune and neurodegenerative diseases that affect the body, brain, and eye. The company’s development pipeline features drug candidates designed to act as potent, selective inhibitors of C1q, to prevent tissue damage and antibody-mediated autoimmune response, as well as to preserve function in synapses associated with cognitive decline complement-mediated degenerative disease. The company’s drug candidates have broad application to multiple complement-mediated conditions. 



All of that’s a mouthful, but what it comes down to is, Annexon is developing drug candidates with multiple indications. The autoimmune program, for example, has 3 drug candidates under investigation for five different conditions. The most advanced of these tracks, featuring ANX005 as a treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome, is enrolling patients in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial, with completion projected for 2023. Earlier data, from the drug-drug interaction study and the Phase 1b trial, was presented this year, and showed an acceptable tolerability profile along with positive therapeutic action. 



The company recently completed a Phase 2 trial of ANX005 in the treatment of Huntington’s disease (HD), and initiated dosing in a Phase 2 trial of the drug against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Data releases on these trials are expected in 4Q21 and during 2022 respectively. Annexon recently expanded its development program with ANX009, a new drug candidate aimed at treating lupus. 



Despite this active pipeline, the company has seen its stock fall 61% from its peak, reached this past March. 



However, JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama remains bullish on Annexon, taking particular note of the company’s multiple shots on goal. 



“In a win scenario, we are looking for a clean safety profile for ANX005 and positive directional trends on key biomarkers (particularly on neurofilament light chain or NfL), with a homerun scenario showing initial / early trends of functional benefit... While we acknowledge that the HD data will be early stage, we note upside scenarios likely will have sentiment pull-through to the broader neurodegeneration efforts (i.e., platform value). Importantly, from current levels, we see upside in ANNX shares on Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) alone (into the mid~$20s) and the broader pipeline, including the phase 2 HD readout, as providing pipeline optionality,” the analyst opined.



Rama rates ANNX shares as Overweight (i.e., a Buy), with a $37 price target to indicate room for 170% appreciation in the next 12 months. (To watch Rama’s track record, click here) 



The JPM view is hardly an outlier here, as the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 4 positive reviews. Shares are priced at $13.7 and the $38 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of a very strong 177% from current trading levels. (See ANNX stock analysis on TipRanks)

520,"What are you thankful for this holiday weekend? Taking a look at the broader picture of the US economy, there’s a lot that’s going right. The jobs situation is improving, wages are up, and consumers are flush with cash. While inflation is high, and remains a problem, we do have the ingredients for a good year ahead.



The stock markets have done their part, too. We should all be grateful for the S&P 500’s record highs and a 25% gain this year. 



So let’s show our appreciation – for strong investment returns. Wall Street’s analysts have been busy finding the stocks that will make you thankful you got into the market, and we’ve used the TipRanks data to get a closer look at three of them. Each has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst community, and stands to notch more gains on top of its already impressive growth. 



Calumet Specialty Products (CLMT)



We’ll start in the industrial sector, where Calumet is a producer of specialty products. The company’s product list includes aliphatic solvents, naphthenic oils, and paraffin waxes. The company has been in business for over a century, and has 10 production facilities putting out more than 3,400 unique end products. Calumet boasts over 2,700 business customers in 90 countries around the world.



This month, Calumet has itself had enough to be thankful for, in the form of some good news for the company. Just last week, the company announced several new strategic partnerships that will enhance its renewable diesel fuel business. These included the investment, as convertible debt, of  $300 million by Oaktree into Calumet’s subsidiary, Montana Renewables (MRL), and the carve out of  MRL as wholly-owned pure-play subsidiary in the renewable fuel market.



Earlier this month, on the 5th, Calumet released its 3Q21 earnings. The top line revenue, of $874.9 million, was the highest in two years, and up 54% year-over-year. EPS did even better. Earnings had been negative for the past seven quarters, but has turned positive and came in at 64 cents profit per share. Impressively, Calumet’s stock is up 380% this year. 



Analyst Roger Read, covering the stock for Wells Fargo, sees the moves on the renewable diesel front as key factors for Calumet going forward. He believes the spin-off of MRL will give the company greater agility in the field, while the investment from Oaktree brings needed capital. 



“The cash infusion from an outside investor helps validate the Renewable Diesel conversion project while maintaining the majority of the project's value for CLMT. Longer term, we see CLMT's willingness to separate renewable diesel from the rest of CLMT as supportive of our SOTP valuation approach and positive outlook,” Read noted. 



To this end, Read rates CLMT an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and his $27 price target implies ~80% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Read’s track record, click here)



""A proactive management team remains focused on establishing the Renewable Diesel ops… Some supply-chain issues remain but CLMT seems to have made it through the worst of the pandemic with margins intact and/ or expanding,” the analyst summed up.



The Wells Fargo view is hardly the only positive take on Calumet. The stock has 5 recent analyst reviews on record, and they include 4 Buys against just 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $15.02 and the $22 average price target indicates room for ~46% growth ahead. (See CLMT stock analysis on TipRanks)







Devon Energy (DVN)



For the second stock on our list, we’ll shift over to the oil and gas industry. Devon Energy is involved in hydrocarbon exploration and extraction, and from its Oklahoma City headquarters the company controls acreage in come of the country’s best hydrocarbon-bearing formations. These include the Delaware and Eagle Ford in Texas and the Williston in North Dakota. Devon is a major player in the energy industry, with a $30 billion market cap and annual revenues that exceeded $2.55 billion, even accounting for the pandemic slowdown in Q2.



Devon’s strong position in the energy industry is clear to see from its financial results this year. In Q1 alone, the company brought in $2.52 billion, nearly matching its 2020 top line total. In Q3, revenues were up 21% sequentially and 230% year-over-year to reach $3.8 billion. Earnings have also been rising, and the Q3 EPS of $1.08 per share was up from a 4-cent loss in the year ago quarter.



Even better, for investors, Devon generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow during Q3. This was a record for the company, the highest FCF in its 50-year history, and up 8x from the FCF at the end of 2020. The solid fiscal performance, and especially the high free cash flow, led Devon to declare an impressive 71% increase in the regular dividend payout, bumping it up to 84 cents per common share. At $3.36 per share, the dividend now yields over 7%.



The company has built these strong results on continued performance from its Delaware Basin holdings. The Delaware is a rich oil bearing formation straddling the Texas-New Mexico state line, and in recent months it has provided up to 80% of Devon’s drilling and production activity. With the company’s output averaging 608,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day during Q3, the scale of the Delaware operations becomes apparent. Devon holds rights to 400,000 acres in this formation, and production beat guidance by 5% as of September 30.



Raymond James’s 5-star analyst John Freeman gives some additional detail on Devon’s Delaware boom: “The Delaware is the engine that drives DVN forward, and it continues to provide impressive results. Most recently the Boundary Raider project, where in 2019 Bone Springs wells broke basin IP records, delivered again in the Wolfcamp with IP30’s of 7,300 Boe/d at 60% oil. DVN also successfully completed the Thistle Cobra project, proving up 3-mile laterals in Lea County.”



In light of this performance, DVN shares have gained a robust 197% this year. Yet, Freeman believes the stock has more room to grow. The analyst rates DVN a Strong Buy, and sets a $65 price target suggesting room for 44% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)



Overall, Devon’s impressive results have brought quite a lot of attention from Wall Street, with the analysts publishing 19 reviews that break down 16 to 3 in favor of Buy over Hold. The average price target of $50.95 implies a one-year upside potential of 13% from the current trading price of $45.09. (See DVN stock analysis on TipRanks)







Enovix (ENVX)



We’ll wrap up with Enovix, a company involved in the development and production of power storage batteries. While that may sound mundane, Enovix is anything but. The company’s products are based on an advanced silicon-anode lithium-ion technology capable of providing a smaller, lighter, more energy-dense battery that existing commercialized lines. Enovix’s product prototypes include a model small and light enough to function in ‘smart’ headsets and eyewear, and another designed for wearable computing devices. The company is also developing a battery line to work with electric automobiles.



This stock is new to the public markets; its shares started trading this past July after completion of a SPAC transaction with Rodgers Silicon Valley Acquisition Corporation. Enovix saw gross cash proceeds of $405 million from the business merger, and the stock has appreciated by a robust 100% since it entered the NASDAQ index. 



While Enovix has not begun commercial production of its products, and so does not show a revenue stream yet, it has met several important milestones in recent months. Back in August, the company announced a Purchasing Agreement and a Cooperation Agreement with a wearable device maker in California. Enovix will receive a reservation fee for manufacturing capacity, along with $3.5 million in pre-payments. The agreement stipulates commercial production in 2025 and a total value of $20 million.



Following up, in September Enovix announced it had released pre-production quantities of its AR glasses battery, the small battery designed for smart headsets. The pre-production was conducted in conjunction with an AR electronics company, and demonstrated smooth operation of the automated assembly line at Enovix’s Fremont, California manufacturing facility.



In coverage for investment firm Colliers, analyst Derek Soderberg takes a bullish stance based on the expansion potential of the advanced battery market. 



“We believe Enovix offers a much greater opportunity in the advanced battery and EV market. Enovix pioneered advanced battery technology and has a multi-year head start vs. competitors -- and is primed to disrupt a massive $60B market. That market could more than double by 2030. And based off the total market valuation of battery incumbents (~$500B), we believe Enovix is undervalued,” Soderberg opined.



To this end, Soderberg puts a Buy rating on Enovix stock, and his $65 price target indicates his confidence in 83% over the coming year. (To watch Soderberg’s track record, click here)



All in all, Enovix has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 positive analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $35.52 and their average target of $46 implies a one-year upside of 29.5%. (See ENVX stock analysis on TipRanks)

521,"In recent years, the technology industry has gone through a transition wherein companies are moving from on-premises products and services to cloud-based services. This has also led to more cyber-attacks on cloud-based infrastructure, creating a need for cloud-based security solutions.



The global cloud security market could be worth $68.5 billion by 2025, according to a MarketsandMarkets research report indicating a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% between 2020 and 2025.



Considering this scenario, let us compare two companies providing cloud-based security solutions, Cloudflare and Zscaler, using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Cloudflare (NET)



Shares of Cloudflare have soared 10.5% in the past month, riding high on the back of strong Q3 results. The website security and web infrastructure company saw its revenues jump 51% year-over-year to $172.3 million, coming in ahead of the consensus estimate of $165.7 million.



This rise in revenues was largely driven by higher traction among the company’s large customers, which rose 71% year-over-year. At the end of Q3, NET had 1,260 large customers. Cloudflare defines large customers as those who pay the company more than $100,000 each year.



It is important here to note that the company generates revenues through subscriptions to access its network and products. It operates a freemium business model where its free customers help it to “attract developers, customers, and potential employees,” according to the company.



Needham analyst Alex Henderson approves of this developer-focused, product-led go-to-market business growth model of the company and believes that this model, along with its free users, results in a “natural demand-pull up-market” where its free users “willingly sample new features and functionality as alpha testers and harden solutions before going-live.”



Another positive for the stock, according to Henderson, is the sheer number of key product announcements by the company, which are difficult to keep pace with. The analyst drew parallels with Amazon (AMZN) in this regard, particularly during the 2012 to 2015 timeframe, when it was introducing a slew of new products.



The analyst added, “The similarities to this innovation engine is one of the reasons we have deep conviction Cloudflare can be a very large company. We believe the flow of new products hearkens back to Cloudflare's large user community and helps drive Dollar-Based Net Retention above 120%.”



The analyst is bullish about the stock with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $140 to $245 (24.1% upside) on the stock.



Cloudflare delivered an adjusted net income of $1.4 million, achieving a major milestone of breaking even in Q3 versus a loss of $5.8 million in the same period last year. Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.04 per share in Q3.



Matthew Prince, Cloudflare’s Co-Founder and CEO, added on its earnings call that the company anticipates hovering ""just below or just above breakeven likely for years to come.” The company is also targeting an operating margin of 20% over the long term.



Even Henderson believes that NET has the potential for its revenues to grow between 30% and 50% over the next three to five years “and sustain Gross Margins in the mid-to-high 70% range while delivering operating leverage.”



The analyst noted that Cloudflare is at “an inflection point in its business model” as “it is pivoting from network investment and a freemium customer capture model to the development of deeper service functionality and a greater focus on large Enterprise adoption.” 



Alex Henderson is ranked by TipRanks as #29 out of more than 7,700 analysts. Other Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Cloudflare, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 9 Holds. The average Cloudflare price target of $208.08 implies 5.4% upside potential to current levels.







Zscaler (ZS)



Zscaler is expected to announce its fiscal first-quarter results on November 30. In fiscal Q1, the company anticipates revenues to be in the range of $210 million to $212 million while adjusted income from operations is expected to be between $18 million and $19 million.



It is important to note here that the company earns revenues primarily from subscription sales that provide customers access to its cloud platform, along with related support services.



The company’s portfolio of comprehensive solutions includes secure access to the Internet and software-as-a-service (SaaS) with Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), segmentation of workload, management of the user-to-application experience with Zscaler digital experience (ZDX), and secure access to internal applications with Zscaler private access (ZPA).



Deutsche Bank analyst Patrick Colville remained optimistic about Zscaler’s Q1 results, as the analyst’s channel checks indicated that the company seems to be “executing well and we saw no signs of a tone downtick in Q1 compared with last quarter.”



Moreover, according to the analyst, ZS also seems to be winning market share from Secure Web Gateway (SWG) vendors like Broadcom (AVGO).



Furthermore, Colville pointed out that in an “upside case,"" ZS could earn revenues in excess of $239 million, up 65% year-over-year, bolstered by the fact that “pipelines indicate no signs of any slowdown in to the end of CY21.”



In fact, according to the analyst, year-to-date, the company’s reseller revenues are up 35% this year, “benefiting from the shift to FWaaS [firewall-as-a-service] and the shift to hybrid-remote.”



Colville particularly noted that against the “robust SASE [secure access service edge] demand backdrop,” Zscaler will continue to benefit “from continued elevated cybersecurity spend, hybrid working and FW-as-a[1]Service adoption.”



As a result, Colville reiterated a Buy rating and raised the price target from $325 to $400 (16.8% upside) on the stock.



Patrick Colville has an average return of 30.5% per rating, according to TipRanks. Other Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Zscaler, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys and 7 Holds. The average Zscaler price target of $333.13 implies 2.7% downside potential to current levels indicating that the stock could have overshot its valuation.







Bottom Line



Analysts are cautiously optimistic about both stocks, and it appears that both companies are poised for growth. However, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Cloudflare seems to be a better Buy.
